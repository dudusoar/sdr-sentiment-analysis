Calling for a hack!
should have arrested the robot
Dead on the spot  . 
Your food will arrive next year
I saw one today it was Madness
good point, I feel dumb now
how does it cross streets without causing traffic
That one just like fall down the stairs bro
Love it  .   but don't think its safe amongst troublemakers
Guessing these guys have never heard of a crowbar before  .  
I live in Canada and I want to capture these robots  .  
The idea is cool but I am kind of scared when this really happens in life  .  
why would you use a robot delivery service when the store is just 2 blocks away?
More likely flying delivery drones  .   That way they don't have to worry about people  .  
You could have someone in India driving this thing for 1/5 the wage of a US driver  .  
I hope the bomb stays warm until the bomb arrives at its location hopefully on time  .  
When I fall over at least I can get back up, but the robot cant  .  
I wonder if they will deliver disease infested hooker's for the campus to study too?
Safe arrival to destination isn't sure  .   Maybe an anti theft alarm should be installed  .  
Because of thieves it will not work  .   Great idea for 30 years ago! And yes vehicles running over it
Nothing new, these have been around and operating over seas for years already in hotels  .   Stolen technology from China
Of course, cheaper for them to buy that robot than paying a waiter (and the price of the coffee stays the same  .  
Wtf that's remote controlled? Why???? Its way faster to have 15 year old's riding bicycles than these slow shitty RC's lmao
I think anyone who spends the money on a lead box to hide the robot in will be disappointed- couple thousand seems a bit of an overestimation
If I ever get my food from something like that I am gonna send it back and tell them I want a real person not a toy
How will these robots make it pass the homeless and chaos  .   O I forgot we are in a pandemic/civil war  .   Timing is for roll out  .  
Another blackmail to the private post companies  .   The thread is not eminent for now , but if they don't innovative they don't have a bright future, they will go down like dinosaur, like kodak did  .  
Gee I buy more than two bags of food  .   So it better for me to do myself to the exercise from the store  .   I mean a car can beat up that little robot driving down the street  .   It might need auto insurance too  .  
Good boy!
Take all my money
They can also talk
Welcome to the future
everyone should try it though
Quit Harassing my Robot  .  
Haha Coco is taking over!
why not help the robot?
totally the robots are smart!
Even robot could make your day
robot does a better job than you
He said while crossing the street!
It also creates jobs for design/maintain them
you are the one who's garbage lmao
You can’t see the bigger picture
will it come to turkey we need it
I like how they made a run for it
Please tell me u helped it get back up dude
I like this  .   More people should see it  .  
Want this in Portland Oregon! I hate grocery shopping  .  
Then you just committed theft, on camera most likely  .  
That is much cuter  .   I want to carry your burdens
Lol  .   It screams if you try to hijack it  .  
What can you help them  .  Don't just recording not helping like nothing happen
like to see that going up gold hill with Hovis bread Dennis  .  
I would protect the dog AND the robot  .   you are cruel
Good now door dash and uber can have someone take those low paying orders
I love how these things start screaming like an social justice warrior when they fall
Why the heck would you do that jerk to hurt the robot?
cool idea Dennis heard they have them in Milton Keynes too
I’m moving to Milton Keynes just so i can use this service
Well, at least you don't have to give it a tip!
well, I mean   .   in smaller areas they might make more sense than drivers
They will be everywhere by end of 2030s  .   Of course everything starts off at high end
it will talk to the thief's, it will know if it's being stolen as well
yes they have these Robots in Milton Keynes   .   Thank you for your view  .  
My college has these on campus  .   I haven't used them yet but I will soon
ok boomer  .   The robot also keeps food hot  .   Get with the times, it's a convenience  .  
That’s just theft, and guess what! They’ve been caught on the onboard camera  .  
Very cool  .   I have seen these robots before but didn't know anything about them  .   Thanks for the quick run down  .  
So dinning hall is crowded use robot, enough students use robot dinning hall not crowded  .   Now I can use dinning hall in peace
We have those here in the UK  .   In Milton Keynes  .   They deliver groceries  .   Funny to see them going about their business  .  
I am sure they would operate fine in the snow with the right tractions on the wheels it’s England not fucking Alaska lol
a way to disrespect someone’s creation don’t blame the robot for being created  .   there are so many freelancing jobs just look for it
Yeah Idk why I went to help them or try to get them to fix themselves every time I saw one stopped in the middle of the sidewalk
Hi, That is a wonderful nice delivery it keeps warm to it gets to you  .   And if anyone touches it in anyway it's a criminal charges  .  
I was in a factory tour, and the robot that's driving around has a horn  .   If someone gets in the way, then it use the horn
Impressive, and this technology is clearly the future  .   Can see these operating very effectively in suburban areas, although in busy cities there are probably too many obstacles  .  
they also employ people to build, program, monitor, and maintain the bots, among many  more jobs  .   don't get left behind, the future is now
There's no way because Amazon's design team thought about criminals when making it and they added location trackers and alarms that sound when the robot is tampered with or touched  .  
Most people on campus love them  .  
Stupid man  .  ! You are supposed to put on a leash on your dog  .   It is for your dog’s safety  .   Oh btw, this happened on Hill St & Main St  .  
it's because of how helpless they are if they get stuck or something goes wrong  .   Could easily break if a car doesn't notice them, and we know how expensive tech like this is  .  
I am looking forward to having it happen in my city soon  .   It's not here just yet but it's coming and I have been following news of these delivery robots for a number of years  .  
I see where you are coming from, but I think that a device that can be aware of its surrounding, and not interfering or harming people walking next to them, could potentially exist well on a pavement  .  
Beatty now the former delivery workers can stay safe by not having to do that type of work  .   Ideally, the money saved on liability etc. can be reinvested into the employees and provide better benefits, higher wages etc.  .   Not everything is doom and gloom  .  
Imagine watching this in 2050
The dog seemed interested  .  
All robots will remember this good karma
What planet was this designed for?
No way this could work profitably  .  
Hahaha ha try that in Florida, USA
Where is this kind of grocery shopping?
Still think drones are a better idea  .  
Seen a lot of these in Purdue campus  .  
How come they didn't install cup holders??
How to prevent thieves stealing the whole robot?
These are probably for fast food not groceries  .  
Every street corner in LA is probably taped off now
Carlos Rodrigues cameras, alarm systems, they’re locked
Bot: I NEED TO DELIVER DRUGS GET OUTA MY WAY
I am pretty sure they will be working on it  .  
Not all kiwibots there are other start ups that use different robots
I'm sure it has its own heater/fridge depending on what you order
Don't worry, industry is not as stupid as you think  .  
Driver should've been paying attention, could've easily been a little kid!
We are losing face to face communication with all these advances in technology
You know they will be spared when the robot up rising happens!
What type of  localization and navigation technology does this robot use?
What does Scout do if it meets a wheelchair on the sidewalk?
We can only hope he recycles and comes back as an MPD Taser  .  
It needs guns  .   I case someone tries to steal it's cargo!
Kind of hard to see below the back window  .   Don't be an idiot  .  
Instead using the money towards professors salaries they use it to deliver lazy kids food
Awesome free groceries just drive around the town  .   Are they allowed to deliver alcohol?
in a city that's live everyone's jib as most orders are only 1-3 miles variance  .  
I do wonder what the liabilities are if someone accidentally trips over one of these  .   
Who the heck keeps a can of oil in their pocket that they can just grab?
That's because they are programmed like that  .   They will give the same response every time
Taking one job and creating few others  .   There is operating companies taking care of these and maintaining them  .  
Can they send beer in those to people who are so blitz they can hardly stand asking for a friend
Will the robots move out of the way for someone in a wheelchair, or someone with a pushchair?
My dad told me about these things yesterday  .   He lives down there  .   I thought he was kidding  .  
We truly are living in the future  .   What kind of future exactly, I am not quite sure  .  
Imagine it just screams " *M O V E* " when someone is Infront of it for a long time
Do you like the convenience of food delivery but hate that it gets to you fast, hot, and fresh?
I agree that labor-saving automations are necessary for societal advancements  .   Historically, however, not all automation ideas become successful  .  
Wouldn't get far, there's cameras and trackers all over it  .   They gone risk gonna jail over some food
Wonder how often these get run over by cars while crossing the street  .   Small and white, easily missed by drivers  .  
They should put giant wheels on them so they can get over any obstacle and be a big inconvenience to anything around it  .  
If they are nice to us and stop anytime when we get in front of them then we need to be nice to them
These things do need a supervisor who drives a van to put them nearer to their delivery/pickup points, so there are some jobs  .  
So, can the get up high rises or do I have to get down to street level? Kind of a buzz-kill if so …
​ get a decent job instead  .   Why deliver food? Do something better with your life  .   It's probably a shit job anyways  .  
Hello Mr. robot! Nah Austin is beautiful y’all tripping  .   Y’all don’t like it go somewhere  .   On this side we positive
Hey, we will still have jobs when they take over I’m gonna start practicing my button pushing skills, and work on being more polite
And if it gets into an accident or gets stuck it does a little high-pitched scream  .   Help me help me help me help me help me! Lol
I am pretty sure the idea is to drive them on sidewalks  .   And yes they probably be either way larger in real deployment, or work only last mile
I am not even the slightest bit worried  .   I literally did nothing to it  .   Plus it was out in public  .   I was fully within my rights to film  .  
Every time I see one of things, I keep thinking Chewbacca is gonna scream at it and scare it away like he did to that little droid in Star Wars  .  
These robots are cute and cool! One question: why not use treads instead of traditional wheels? Treads can help it navigate difficult terrain and make it harder for it to get stuck  .  
Bro it's an inanimate object! So *WHY* do I feel so bad for it just sitting there like it's scared! Well maybe not inanimate, but it's just a robot lol  .  
you got house in woods? if not then drone can fly above trees and fly in a straight line when car robot gonna drive and take a lot of turns, less efficient than a drone  .  
Well it does help productivity :/ No people is more productive than a robot  .   No matter what you say or do eventually most things will be automated because robots are a lot better at doing work than we are  .  
Damn, what the hell are they gonna steal? My Chinese food? Because they would need to be a skilled engineer to be able to find and disable a tracker and scholars don't stoop to petty unprofitable theft  .  
Remember its locked  .   and waiting hours for it to die and drilling it open it open is kind of a waste just for a 15$ meal  .   Plus remember you have to take it home to your cage till probably track its last location
That's why it will never service Oakland and like communities  .   But go to the suburbs and similar, with low- crime rate and well planned, mapped and lit communities, then you have a service people will use - think elderly etc.  .  
The earlier versions actually didn't have an alarm but it's also not really necessary since they are locked, stacked with cameras and constantly tracked with GPS  .   The alarm is just a gadget  .   But surprisingly, the robots don't really get ambushed anyways  .

Add another cost factor to the groceries  .  
I see these being stolen very easily  .  
Less jobs for South Americans  .   Good job
Sidewalks are for people, not robots  .  
What if someone just kicks the robot ?
I think using drones is better than this
Won't last 15 minutes in some areas  .  
The robots have come for what's theirs
What if it steps in dog shit ?
Ok now there gonna be stealing COCO
then just give it a push with your foot
We will tip robot over just for fun   .

Who the fuck didn't secure that shit?
That humans we can put out of work  .  
That thing people rob robots  should definitely be happening
I agree with you robots will take our jobs
I would fight a robot for my dog too
Coco almost ran me and my mom over today
and slowly  they will replace us with robots
Robot blow up now I want my order refunded
This will not work in New York City lol
When post mates got tired of paying their employees  .  
I am sorry but people are gonna steal it
More people being put out of a job  .  
Also people rob it and eat the food  .  
Wait until someone engages in an intercourse with them
This thing is just asking to be robbed  .  
drones are way better  .   3d gives way less obstructions
True, drones are better than the delivery robot
but hard to get approved and properly regulated  .  
Yea it might end in a car accident  .  
It's illegal to drive on the sidewalk!
People are just gonna start stealing the robots
Yeah I am real afraid of AI taking over
I wish nothing but epic failure for this system
Cool but, at the time scary nevertheless  .  
And on that day Skynet became self aware  .  
They cant open the gate  .   Case closed  .  
Imagine using this to find where people live
Oh yeah nobody is gonna take that
A box on wheels is adorable???
Until people start attacking robots for some free food
Surprisingly the cops didn't detain it for id
The robot is the murderer  .   The dudes inside
Now the evidence is tainted! Thanks Uber!
Something terrible must have happened to your robot :(
Driving toilets nice I am so proud of this community
It will be kick down by some yobs  .  
as long as it gets the job done  .  
Lets hope self driving cars aren't this useless  .  
the people who delivered it maybe get hungry lmao
Hah  .   Probably the robot will stalk us  .  
but Ukraine is proof evidence that it needs to happen
Puts the shopping in the robot without gloves
gonna be a nation of fat people  .  
Time to end this madness before its too late
omg its almost guaranteed to be robbed lol
Impressive, jump on and get a lift?
They are putting Polish people out of work!
THEY MAKE BETTER & CHEAPER SLAVES THAN HUMANS  .  
You know it  .   Scouse kids driving them around
In my community  .   The robot would go missing
Can we please stop with this stupid shit?
I am sorry but I find this creepy LOL
What the fuck is that id break its wheels
Exactly why that place is a shit hole lol
This will never work in a black neighborhood  .  
This thing is just asking to get kicked  .  
In America that thing will be target practice  .  
They took our jobs!
so this will only be for rich white neighborhoods
this will go well in a ghetto neighborhood  .  
I wonder how long until one is mugged?
This would work in Canada Not in the US
pretty sure these robots are gonna get smashed   .  
Who’s ready to get their packages stolen
God  .   I just want to kick it  .  
I would be the person that would ride it
What if someone take the whole thing away?
What if somebody steals it and loots it?
some dipshit kids will kick it over for fun
Someone is  gonna lose their job lol
Is this an out of season April fools joke
 it is slow as hell
you can steal other packages but a great idea
Wow it's like Uber eats without people jobs
First signs of America’s country wide obesity
I saw a guy throwing feces on the robots

Robots are gonna have more rights than us
I will never use this type of service  .  
His buddy over there watched him getting brutally killed
So that's what happened to my order  .  
 it is taking a job of a human
This another way to take away peoples jobs sad
the robots are not cheap as we are
Waiting someone losses his job then hijacks this robot
black mirror could now be a reality  .  
can someone jump this robot and take its food
I for one, welcome our new robot overlords
Aren't they worried about someone stealing it?
next up - homeless man attacks delivery robot for food
Damn robots coming over here taking immigrants jobs  .  
The feel when the minimum wage goes to high
*smash and grab the food  .   Free FOOD  .  *

Does anyone feels like the need to kick it ?
Obviously not, I just threw it out there  .

Police would probably arrest it for not giving details  .  
Now they will all get robbed thanks to you lol
Turn the thing upside down job killer pure and simple
It will be on blocks with the wheels missing Haha
Or join the super market trolleys in the local canal

people gonna be running these over all the time
people don't have jobs and no money = No groceries
ohm gosh, now robots are taking over peoples work
someone still waiting for their food to be delivered  .  
So one pack at a time? this seems very inefficient
Does it also give money and food to homeless people
I would kick it over, just out of principle
Yeah, take even more jobs from humans  .   Brilliant!
But with way worse reaction time, and way dumber  .  
Seems to me any evidence collected here has been corrupted  .

These stupid things have no reason to be on the sidewalk
This would absolutely get stolen anywhere else in the world  .  
Say No to Robotics These phones and iPad are enough  .  
Unless someone on the streets stops it and steals our food
exactly  .   people are blind  .   All they are doing is replacing humans
Every time you see these you should smash it up   .  
Wait till people start stealing them or smash and grabbing them
And they trying this in la out of all places fail
Can not someone just grab it and go home with it?
Thieves and cost will stop them  .  
Those robots suck if you ride a bike on campus!
The fact is it is another version of the trojan horse
Shouldn't the police stop robots from entering crime scenes?
It would not work in high Wycombe with all the hills
Wake up people you are starting to be replaced!!
They will be in a river or a ditch rotting away
The FedEx bot looks way to expensive for mass deployment  .  
All horrible designs that will be costly and clutter the streets

"The robot can be remote controlled" And robbed  .  
I will bash it to pieces with my baseball bat  .  
these robots could be tampered with, stolen, etc.  .  
How if the thief use EMP jammer to the bot?
It would take, what, 30 minutes to go 2 miles?

The homeless in America would have a new ice chest !
You see a robot, I see a free lunch  .

I slowly believe that amazon building army very  slowly  .  
1 ax and 0 packages make it to the block that day  .  
Lets see some deliveries on the south side of Chicago  .

I live in the up and they would be trashed  .  
The robot is cute but don't like the implications of it
Ok what if the delivery person gets hit by something?
I wonder if anyone has stolen the food from it  .   
The test is not Toronto  .   Philadelphia, another story  .   
I have these in my hood now they testing them out
Totally gonna snatch deliveries as they go down the sidewalk  .  
Seen them getting stuck in the middle of cross walks impeding traffic
Pavements are for people  .   These things should be on the road
I will give anyone 10 bucks who blocks and flashes the robot!
Yea you may lose your job but hey this is the future
Or a teenager walking by gives it a kick into traffic  .  
it's not cool if you lost your job to a robot
I am more worried about the food what if someone steals the food
I saw a video where one was hit by a train lol
my friend rode it and he didn’t get in trouble
Hey, that's pretty awesome if someone start robbing the robot

Mark my words AI is far more dangerous than nukes - Elon Musk
Lol that is gonna get mugged every time in London  .  
more people to the unemployment line  .   but hay "progress"
They say this will slow down time  .   They was not kidding
Rolling over a body and dropping hot coffee all over the evidence
Surely someone gonna trap one in a circle of traffic cones
As soon as I saw that I wanted to punt it   .  
Most of the time its seen at a crosswalk just stuck  .  
Kill them before they take over our jobs and our world  .  
Criminals everywhere are putting together outfits to disguise themselves as robots  .  
"Killer Robot Returns to Scene of Crime to Destroy Evidence"
If I see one of these I am fucking smashing it up
Notice how it's all lazy fat buggers using it
Excellent more job losses for those trying to earn a living!
Or why nobody minds replacing the poorest peoples jobs with robots  .  
my mom doesn't want to buy deliveries by these robots :(
Also I still think someone could steal whatever is in it
How many of these are gonna get stolen or vandalized? Hundred percent
and when flying drone delivery starts all these will be obsolete  .  
this bro we got to stop taking jobs away from real people
THE ROWDY KIDS ARE gonna  DESTROY & ROB THOSE THINGS   .  
Stupid people will die because robots are taking up their jobs  .  
They were not kidding when they said robots are replacing people  .  
I saw a kid sitting on one and it was still moving
Sounds great, but you know people are gonna steal/vandalize it
It's cute until someone straps a machine gun to it  .  
Wait till the curbside drug dealers get ahold of this  .   lol
Yeah we will be finding the robot stalking us soon  .  
Dumb robots > dumb undergrads with their face stuck in their phone  .  
Groceries for whom? A rabbit!? It's tiny!
Just drop a bin bag over the top and boom FREE FOOD
This technology is designed to put people out of a job  .
Easy for highway robbers, or maybe it can defend itself  .    .  
That would be stolen here if there's food in it lol
When I see one I am having me a new coffee table
Hold it to ransom hand over £500 or the robot gets it
No way would that survive in my area,  it would be trashed
Don't help robots take our jobs  .   This is dumb as fuck
I would put 2 bricks front and back of a wheel lmao  .  
This thing wouldn't make it 2 feet in a democrat city law
They grow up so fast Delivery robot today, Skynet tomorrow!
Comical Every wise ass kid will be messing with these on TikTok
Imagine if it was stuck in mud and couldn't get there
This why my package late  .   This 3mph mini sups mailvan slow  .  
Stick some beer in there and I am sold!!!
What if you covered your face and body to steal the robot？
I hope so, imagine how easy it would be to steal
Nice, but probably won't work in a bad neighborhood  .  
We are literally getting so lazy in this world it's ridiculous
I would run that POS over and eat for free  es
I wonder if you could just open it and take the shit
I see a lawsuit for disable folks that can't bend over
Imagine Robbery being that easy for some free snacks for the homeless
Fucking robot can have my job any day of the week  .  
very bad suspension, half the wheels never touch the road
Not if I smash it with a hammer and steal it  .  
even if it's locked  .   they could steal the robot itself
I have seen the future and it does not include us  .  
There will be a reason to remove them from the streets  .  
Google buzz feed's video where they try attacking it for food
true, they should just scrap the whole idea in general honestly
Another job that 'eventually' will be completely replaced by a machine  .  
once one got in front of my car and it just died
Good for a drug dealer  .  no more standing on corners  .  
AI will really take over jobs  .   Nvidia, AMD,   .  
A world where we don’t need jobs for people  .  
I love how some robots are beat up a bit but still rolling…
I am gonna tag on those if I see one
Stealing jobs and promoting laziness  .   Sounds like a great idea!
What happens when someone vandalizes the bot? Steals the food?
What happens when you vandalize one?
The robot needs weapon  .   What if someone tries to steal robot?
What if a bunch of kids start to play with it?
What's to stop this thing from getting hit by a car
Wouldn't your food smell like previous food in the container?
"What if there's a bomb?" Americans these days  .  
ROBOTS ARE THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE SO JUST RIDE THE WAVES BRO
These will get stolen  .   Where are the rebels without a cause  .  
Canadians destroy the robot also  .   Canadians are the world's #1 robot destroyers  .  
plenty of assholes in Los Angeles  .   They will destroy the robots  .  
Sometimes people even try to steal them
future AI will hunt down those kids for causing suffering to their ancestors
More And More Positions getting automated  .   More people to be jobless  .  
Not more important than protecting his dog even though he kicks the robot
Someone will steal or vandalize it  .   Better to be a flying drone
You think these are smart  .   One got hit by a train  .  
If this robot was used forever the delivery guys will lose job :(
wait I hear Ohio?! food delivery robot in Ohio is dangerous
people rob it and eat the food  .   since it is not that fast
A new drunk person game! Kick the robot on its side!
It would take everything in me to not push that thing over  .  
Sherwood either way  .   people can get creative when they steal stuff  .  
put on a mask next time and throw it off a bridge
These type of unmanned transports can not be used in uncivilized area's
You already know the food frozen by the time it gets to you
Aha that's exactly my fear! They go kind of too slow  .  
Plot twist: its been sent by the criminal to destroy the evidence
Turn it into a real soup kitchen for dirty Mike and the boys
The weed consumption at that university is gonna be out of control
it's all fun and games until somebody turns this to an rc-xd
To create alibi as to why it's marks were at the scene
It better bring a murder souvenir or I am not tipping the robot
they can’t do that and wouldn’t be allowed  .  
It will get stuck somewhere some how  .   Free food is coming  .  
The FedEx one is def the worst  .   FedEx please give up  .  
Bad idea! That's just asking for things to be stolen!
I believe the plan is to let the robots do the delivery work
I don't care what anyone says, AI will kill us  .  
Because catching your robot when someone is hungry seems like a good idea
What if robots will replace 99% of what humans are capable of doing  .  
I wish I would of caught you on campus BRO!!!
The news gets more weird by the day  .   What a pointless machine
If they were in Middlesbrough someone would probably steal it or wreck it
Lol, where I live that would get robbed in a heart beat
Wow I had no idea this was happening anywhere!? Crazy!
I don't think that's the droid you are looking for!
Yep no need for delivery drivers now, yet another job gone  .  
On my estate these would be a great way of delivering weed  .  
Chip shops? Wow I am imagining how many seagulls follow those deliveries
These will become the norm, then they wont need delivery drivers  .  
I was thinking same thing   .    .  law abiding youths on bmx's trashing them
I spotted one in Northampton with a dildo stuck on top of it
So cute and I am Sure assholes steal them or Take the Order out
That robotic delivery Rover stuck in road cross, because of traffic  .  
That thing wouldn't last 30 min in Portland before a tweaker disassembles it

Can't wait to trip over one and put a claim in  .  
Some hooligan is just gonna break it open and steal the package

Just put a sign that says 'Steal Me' on it and be done
How much does scout weigh? Will it fit in my trunk?

If you give them weapons it's basically Terminator but in real life
What happens if somebody steals the box with all the food inside ?
Here comes the robots  .   Coming soon no more jobs for humans  .  
Robot food service, that must be as slow as dust  .  
They need to attach flame throwers to the robot  .   Problem solved  .  
Think a red party cup would fit over it's Laser sensor?
Put a picture of a very long tunnel over the camera eye!
Because they don't belong on the sidewalk where people are walking  .  
It doesn't have to replace 100% of delivery jobs, just 50% or more
Won’t work in Oakland  .   They would be vandalized and stolen
THEN THE WORLD WOULD BECOME FEW BILLIONAIRES AND REST OF THEM ARE POOR
It will be a victim of the smash and grab people , unfortunately
we just have to completely rebuild the whole country so they work  .  
Yes a future where it takes 2 hours to get a cold takeaway delivered  .  
“What happens  .   when the enemy steals the keys!!?”
Taking our jobs left and right  .   Someone should smash it with a bat
That would Never last in Philly  .   We kill robots here  .   RIP hitch Bot
so is robot cruelty the next “rage” then? lol garbage technology
One day we will be the robot and the robots will be kicking us
Corporate greed to get the driver out of it and take all the money
It's okay if you like bending over to get your order  .   lol
Man that thing cant go on a highway  .   Your safe, promise  .  
Someone will be stupid and kick it over or hit it with their car
Too bad some people don't know how to respect other peoples property  .  
I would just put it inside a faraday cage until batteries are dead  .  
Some silly people steal cars and bikes, and potentially robots in the future
I think technology is useful in so many ways, this is not one
These machines will be attacked, beaten open and robbed in no time!
That is replacing people, and people do not seem to mind  .   Seriously
Wonder what you will think when you lose your job because of a machine
Just make sure to only order scrambled eggs otherwise you will lose a lot
Can only live in a white neighborhood I am telling you that right now  .  
To say that I saw on of the robot got run over by a train
its gonna run over a gnome and may kill a smurf ban them
Runs over a body and shows up to your door with blood on it
The mafia boss orders drugs guns ammo bulletproof vest and a slice of pizza
What a nice benefit area lad to get the free food from the robots
In this case it's your job replaced as a shop visiting costumer  .  
What if a load of chavs smash it up and take the food?
How to solve this problem that the robot confronts thieves or bad guys?
Someone will take a shit in it depending on the part of town  .  
You people are so dumb  .   These can be easily stolen by kids  .  
Food robots are a garbage idea not going to lie One got hit by a train once
What happens when the robot falls sideways in the middle of the road?
There are gonna be a lot of empty smashed robots of the streets
Saw one of these walking through Oakland and wanted to kick it so bad
All my fellow riders this is what's gonna make us unemployed  .  
Is anyone else just looking at that and wanting to tip it over?
Just another gimmick that's gonna put someone out of a job!
I don't think that would survive on our estate, its pure money
Where I live the chavs would have smashed that and nicked the groceries  .  
We don’t want this crap or drones doing deliveries  .   slippery slope
If it needs to rely on kindness and good will it might not survive
Still needs a people to press the lights WTF what a thick fucking idea
Won't be long it be delivering gram coke and a deal of weed
Stay away form New York don’t want to get a bad rating
And this is the start of the robot takeover of the people race  .  
Delightful manners  .   Would not last long over here  .   A pity  . 
But  .   Won't black people be stealing them and the stuff inside?
I am gonna smash your fucking robots to pieces  .   Fuck amazon  .  
The problem is anyone can just stop it and steal the package that easy
this is useless thing for investors money, no future in that case  .  
Not sure I want them on the sidewalk, could be A tripping hazard
Imagine that thing sliding out of control down a steep icy hill  .   
Will this thing work in downtown LA ? It might get raped there  .  
Can't wait to kick these over when walking down the street!
Couldn’t someone just come up to that thing and steal it?
anyone could steal that robot, is not a secure delivery to my door
I am quite sure they will charge extra just like with same day delivery
Great, so people can just swipe all the parcels when the lid opens
it takes paid JOBs , make America jobless again! (and amazon boss richer)
Can't have that in the hood then homeless people will jack it  .  
What a way to try and kill the job economy  .   Good job  .  
Waiting to see videos of the Daytona Beach homeless riding them around town  .  
believing a food delivery robot is the new dystopia device to police people  .  
If I see one I’m picking it up and taking your pizza
What is stopping people from snatching up food that isn't theirs lol?
Fools will tag on that thing in the Bay Area  .   Or jack the food
thousands pizza delivery jobs will be gone once this takes off the ground  .  
rofl with cities like California, those robot be robbed in no time  .  
Yeah and in Oakland they will steal your groceries and the robot. good luck
How long Before these are vandalized, burned to a crisp or just stolen
Can’t somebody just run off with them and take them apart?
so if you try to kick it, then it will start escaping?
Poor robot is gonna get robed at gun point one day  .   poor thing
People who order food: how long it take I am starving in my house
Don't help it damn I was just trying to bootfuck it off the side walk
Until some kid kicks it over for fun and your food gets tumbled around  .  
 *Roommate and I grabs Coco, reprograms her and give her a new home*
Random hacker dude comes up, turns off gps, takes the robot, PROFIT
In America those things would be vandalized or shot up on the first trip  .  
Until someone steals it, bet they aren't using it in the hood  .  
Good for that guy who kicks the robot, I want to be his friend
Its not, its something homeless people need to attack to get free food  .  
Does it deter a lot of angry postal workers who were replaced by it?
And how long will these stupid things last? Destroyed in seconds me thinks  .  
They surely won't bring these to the up they will end up in canals
Well it won't be long before some people will be stealing them Also!
I hope it gets there in 30 minutes or less because it's a time bomb
Am I the only one who noticed the hole in the back if the robot
Don't try this in Chicago  .   They won't make it to the corner
Fantastic idea to do away with people resources soon people will not have a job
Just imagine these robots getting hit by a car as they cross the street  .  
Oh no, will the president build a wall against these robots?
What if somebody else has their phone, or if somebody hacks the robot?
That's ridiculous they didn't stop that they are like oh Robots coming through
some Brazilians are just awful and would steal them or break or do anything stupid
Great! have to look out for robots while I am driving now  .  
This makes it too easy to be lazy & forget what it is to be human
One can either open them using a code or a smack on top of them
Just waiting for the news of someone being run over by one of these  .  
Amazon scout will end up getting vandalized as soon as it enters the ghetto 
They might as well create a robot that will eat your food as well  .  
you should see the train one man got crushed by a train with an alarm
If dogs don't attack it I think it will happen sooner then later  .  
I am sure people would start to rip all expensive parts/metals and sell them somewhere
Any time a robot takes a human's job is a damn shame  .  
The first time I saw one of these driving through Oakland I nearly wrecked  .  
Why is the woman not wearing gloves to put the food in the robot?
Just imagine all the contaminants and germs on the outside surface of those robots   .  
Good bye the van drivers, next building houses then good bye the builders etc.  .  
Lol round my way they would get burned out or nicked by local chavs   .  
if that comes to Ellesmere Port, the local chavs will half inch it!
these are just gonna get robbed every five minutes  .   just wait and see
When needs be, someone's gonna know where to find free food!
I heard about it though  .   Little droid will put people out of work  .  
Its really sad that something like this could be not used all over the UK
So when robots do all the immigrant jobs, what will they do??
Gypsies near me would use it as a little vehicle to travel between caravans  .  
These machines are gonna take me out of work and others like me  .  
In Saskatchewan they would use these things as seat cushions and a portable toilet  .  
Blacks be like  .    .   You guys always have to ruin it for everyone huh?
these guys have had plenty of practice disabling the GPS trackers on the scooters already
Yeah, on my country that would be robbed or destroyed on the second day
Haha they will be vandalized easy! and this delivery is very slow and insufficient
You used this in France Saint Denis, the robot will be disappear after 10 minutes
The customers will spill their coffee on the robots and gum up the mechanisms  .  
We all know this  .   I am pretty sure it will never be deployed  .  
Awesome; but let’s please employ people, not replace them with robots
Those Schmo's will be hacked and the deliveries made to a Frat house  .  
This takes away the easier work and limits the available remaining jobs for humans  .  
What if someone touches it and stops it and grabs the food and just leaves
Now I see where all the stolen tips are going, to there door dash robot
if a drug dealer hacked into one of these they would be set for life
This is so stupid  .   We won't be hearing from Door Dash ever again  .  
In terms of a business, This seems like a failure waiting to happen  .  
What is that? People just hating cause they think these will replace workers  .  
One day someone might put a dildo in it after they get their food  .  
but what will stop consumers spending is losing their jobs  .   to AI and robotics
I guess crime going up doesn't matter   .   These robots are gonna jacked
imagine someone takes a Sharpie and covers the QR code then they cant open it
Not very good if you need a big shop they are very slow as well
Fine, fine, but 100 robots on the streets equals 100 people struggling to find work  .  
Yes  just in time to take more jobs, excellent, just as planned  .  
Won't be long B4 the tent living dregs use it as a portable toilet  .  
when businesses like these actually happening, u know its time to see the bubble pop
Now go find out what they do to the animals to get you pizza then   .  
I don't trust the drone coco to do anything but take away gig worker jobs
Dog: "Oh  .   look! a portable fire hydrant  .   How convenient!"
some people like all this, they wont like it when its doing there job though
I am gonna run into a bunch of these robots with my pick up truck
This a joke, people will bash it to bits and steal whatever is inside  .  
Way too slow and your customers food will be cold by the time it reaches destination
This is a good meal for a homeless guy with a knife or pry bar  .  
Can you imagine one of these in Detroit Wheels tires be gone whole thing gutted
I know some drunk fucks are gonna smash it up and steal the goods inside
,Never gonna work  .   People will mess with them - you just know it  .  
damn, if we had this here in Brazil he would eventually be drug dealing  .  
Now I have to see a video of those robots getting struck by lightning  .   ️
I don’t get why Americans have these? That’s just peak laziness
Finally an opportunity for tramp like me to get free illegal foods while attending college  .  
Cute? It's a box on wheels  .   You need to get out more  .  
U know on Wall-E where at the end all the humans were overweight  .   Humans in 1000years
This “future” we live in right now is horrible , humanity is killing ourself
Everyone in this world will get lazy and have robots do every thing for us  .  
That's a very ugly robot  .   Better check these starships rolling the streets of Finland
Once robots take over nobody has a job fantastic idea  .   There goes common sense again
I bet the robots can't swim and I bet they are not immersion proof  .  
I have never used one because I would walk to wherever it would deliver from  .  
No more physical labor technology is taking every thing physical labor next generation is in trouble
I swear to god the food is always be all over the Place in the robot
stupid bots no wonder peoples food delivery is stuck somewhere on a gaps map  .    
Great you have killed delivery jobs  .   Why not encourage people to switch to cycles  .  
 I think they would have a hard time in the middle of DC  .  
or is this a way of making people stay at home and be a prisoner?
Using a "good cause" to normalize the robots which will replace delivery drivers  .  
That won't last two seconds when it comes up to a gang of yobs  .  
That would get taken to pieces on my estate kids would have it off in minutes
They are getting attacked with golf clubs and raided if they come near my street lol
such a shame it wouldn't last 5 minutes in some places ️
Machines are gonna take over they will be the boss of us on the streets
Kill it before it kills you, how many movies do we have to see?
Put a fence round it  .   Or a bit of black spray paint on the camera
There's probably a migrant hiding in it straight from the beaches of Southern England  .  
It’s probably terrified after one of its kind got ran over my a train
My dog bikes the wheels on those robots  .   every time they see one they just switch
If that thing shows up here in Sweden I would gladly let Russia nuke us!
People don't know surveillance even if it brought them food and even would assist it
This is how they are creating unemployment! That's what these big companies want  .  
I can already see black people trying to put it in theirs cars and driving away
soon it will fire out Amazon rockets and deploy a single drone to nuke a house
Awesome, can't wait for all my packages to be stolen  .   Thanks Amazon  .  
If I see this robot I will take him inside and keep it as a pet
you did not understand that this will create millions of unemployed   .   you are stupid   .  
When the machines take over, they will judge us on how we treated Scout  .  
You blatantly ripped off Starship robot's design  .   That's quite a dick move  .  
Almost as much of a waste of time and money as the Prime Video originals  .  
I don't know why but I feel like this is some kind of a joke
It will be at the side of the road on bricks with the wheels missing  .  
This is true, I am gonna beat the shit out of amazon robots  .  
1  .   This thing's slow af 2  .   People are gonna crash into/steal/vandalize the _____ out of these
I say give it a week before there demolished by people not paying attention while driving
Try this in the hood and see how far computer homie gets before getting capped  .  
“Your order got crushed by a train while it was coming to your destination”
But he just stopped by a train that makes no sense he had to look out
There's been a recent influx of homeless people buying sledge hammers to break the robots
its a dumb idea so no it nots  .   it disregard stairs and homeless people  .  
it  needs a people to basically control it why not just deliver the food yourself
People wouldn't steal the food in it, they would steal the robot instead  .  
will the libs advocate for robot rights even though the bots are taking their jobs?
I am afraid teens will abuse & vandalize it for social media views or bragging rights  .  
It is the American way to replace the worker then complain that there are no jobs  .  
in universities is fine but for barrios or cities will never work that robot will be vandalized
It would also be a 100% mission failure when the Alt-Right runs these robots over with their cars
And how long before robot mugging and piracy starts  .   Bet it won't be long  .  
leave a note: "my fingerprints are there because I helped on it's path"
No one ever thought about making "special" deliveries with that drug mule on wheels?
I feel like you kind of have an obligation to destroy it in a mask and run away
Its only a matter of time till a drunk college kid takes a dump inside one lol
What if someone puts a bomb in it and make it explode in a highly populated place
Do you want to add a mechanism to unload it when the customer isn't here ?
I am surprised that this little guy is still in one piece  .   You know  .   Ohio
I just saw a video about one getting obliterated by a train  .   Such a sad moment
Can’t people just steal the food or mess with the robot to stop the delivery
Nice  .   But these robots will easily get killed by scooters in Taipei I am sure  .  
That's why drone delivery is better  .   Also what if it gets used to carry a bomb
In this future no one works  .   we are all home ordering food and usb cables  .  
Will be a failed concept because with three different competing systems, none can become profitable  .  
We need to band together and fight automation in trucks, food delivery and it rideshare  .  
Yeh  .   Robots taking over people jobs  .   and this is what we get: shit lol
What's so important a people can't 'pop to the shops' it's stupid utterly ridiculous
They will steal peoples job  .   soon there will be a uprising  .   time has come  .  
I would go far out of my way and possibly off road to run that thing over
If any of the robots fall over they are fucked  .   Also what if it rains?
Don’t forget you’ll lose your job and get replaced by these things!
I am guessing all of these thing will only be in the "nice" neighborhoods ??
Just one question  .   Has anyone been reported yet for grabbing one and holding it hostage?
The sidewalk is a pedestrian area and these carts on the sidewalk will just annoy people  .  
Don’t help those little bustards  .   They’re taking money away from families  .  
People be helping these robots as if they are actual living things people are stupid for sure
A whole big train just hit one of these delivery robots in some kind of weird city
Well we won’t have to worry about robots taking over for quite some time  .  
Am I missing something here? Are food deliveries done on cars in US??!
You think that child's toy is more advanced than Tesla's AI? haha funny  .  
"The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people" - Karl Marx
"The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people" - Karl Marx
Yeah I haven't seen them anywhere else  .   They would probably get mugged down in Southside
I would smash that robot into next week to get my hands on that lovely bog roll
well the rise of self aware robots coming soon near you, soon we will have terminators lol
Can't wait till they up my way  .   I need some batteries to make a ebike
Wouldn't work in Hartlepool  .   It would be stolen and stripped for parts in seconds  .  
I think this is how Uber delivers McDonald’s cause it’s always cold  .  
I live in central Scotland and I know it would get mugged and have the wheels nicked
Well  .   Defo would be nicked where I live lol  .   Or the kids would brick it
These will never work in the USA  .   Too many joggers will steal all the food  .  
Ordered takeout and try an sit on it to get home doesn’t work trust me
Pretty neat but even in small town Kansas the meth heads would tear it apart for scrap
This is the UK? I never seen one of those here I would hold it hostage
If that thing was in the US it would have been snagged and stripped for parts already
England is not that different  .   It’s only a matter of time someone steals it
With that pace I think my delivery will come several weeks later  .   it's too slow
It gives it to the first person that promises to keep it safe for you  .   LOL
So what happens when I decide to walk over and kick that thing on its side?
If I see this POS, I will kick it off a sidewalk - under the bus :)
I just want to kick it!!!!!!!!!!!
Exactly what I was thinking  .   It looks this robot could only work in specific settings  .  
I will do my best to get this useless sidewalk bully shipping cart ban in my city
I want to kick one over, and watch as it panics and tries to upright itself
You want little robots to kick over too? Because I would love to kick them  .  
Me sister see the robot can’t make it up hills at her school  .   (NAU)
It also puts real people out of work… I dare it to come to Philadelphia, ️
In my hood the Paleteros get jacked  .   how you think that Robo-cooler gonna fend?
I mean this robot didn't stop at the train stop like the other food robot did
What’s funny about anyone using robots to replace people and their jobs? Nothing!
The homeless around me would be more interested if the robot was carrying drugs or booze!
That's exactly what I was thinking!!  homeless man will attack delivery robot for food
This Bitch out here stealing jobs while Other people hustling to bring food to their families
If they launch in San Francisco then the SF homeless can use it to transport Drugs  .  
I am waiting for the first report of one of these Robots getting kidnapped by Joggers lol  .  
seriously though, if you can find it' nuts, you can kick it in the nuts  .  
Sadly, these can be driven from anywhere and those jobs will be outsourced to other countries  .  
I can pick up little coco take it home, open it up and eat the food lol
there is already videos of homeless and other people messing with the robot  .   Nobody cares lol
people will just try to steal it or its content eventually, if they aren't already sadly
it’s slow asf i just walked past one lol it’s walking speed going downhill
alarms, cameras, robot would be destroyed, food stolen in NYC, even Atlanta Georgia  .  
i saw a video about two homeless jerk fighting with the bot, probably NYC or Philadelphia  .  
damn I am looking forward to free delivery if there no one to pay I must be free lol
This might work in Singapore but that thing wouldn't last a day in L  .  A before being stolen
Those wouldn't last 2 minutes in an urban environment  .   Chavs would be on it like a rash
And how do you keep people from just opening it up and stealing what’s inside?
Just enclose the robot in a big enough metal box! no RF signals, no GPS  .  
And who would buy the food when robots do all the work and people have no jobs?
I am gonna quit my job and make a full time career out of stealing these things
Can't manage stairs, but the Daleks took over the galaxy without using stairs, beware!
That's Awesome because some of the humans will eat and drink the food before they deliver it
what if someone Tripped the robot And Just Stole The Food? And Siri is TAKING OVER
And the data they gather on us can be sold to friendly and kind corporations  .   Yay  .  
People trip over these machines, companies are sued and soon out of business  .   The end  .  
That just might fit in the back of my van   .   €10,000 or the bot gets it!
yeah I don’t care about the robot, just saying kids will probably break the robots
wouldn't a thief use a bat as more of a universal key rather than an app?
That's just what we need more machines taking over people jobs, I hate this stupid world
Don't help them  .   These things are gonna take millions of low paid jobs across the globe
They are gonna remember who laughed at them and who helped them when Skynet takes over  .  
sure but your design is backwards and people are not gonna be afraid to steal from them
Great idea but people will destroy, damage, steal from, or just steal the entire robot
I could see one of these running over my grandma as she slowly walks down the sidewalk!
Free shopping  .   The first of many bribes awarded to nurses who keep quiet about the hoax  .  
Wont make it 2 mins from start point here in Birmingham kids be riding on them for a start
They wouldn't last here in the West of Scotland  .   They would end up in Cash Converters
I would be so tempted to turn it over to see if it could right itself …  .  
That area was very well planned and thought out ,wouldn't last 5 mins in most areas   .  
They won't last long in a food crisis   .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .  
Turn the bloody thing on it's back and see how long it takes to be rescued  .  
I am from Liverpool, guaranteed it would be up on bricks with no wheels after a night
I would use the bits to upgrade the Big Trak I have still got in the loft   .  
Don't let scousers see this, it will get stolen as soon as it leaves the building
And that's why I wouldn't invest in this company because they still need people help  .  
"This just in: Serial killer android disguised as Starship delivery robot kills family of four"
That thing will end up missing real quick where I live due to all the bums out here
That thing would turned into a crack seller  .   In jersey city them wheels would be gone  .  
Ridiculous how few parcels could fit in it and what's to stop thieves?! !
Stop occupying our sidewalks A-hole  .   If I find one I am gonna tip it sideways  .  
That must be one of the most ridiculous piece of music I have ever been listening to  .  
So the only thing the thief has to do is to follow one around during Christmas time?
Can't wait until these "cute" autonomous robots will have autonomous machine guns mounted on them
He's trying to save $3 from each drivers, and customers no longer have to tip lol  .  
It's all fun & games till one of these things takes your job  .   Then nukes everyone  .  
This robot's much too big for the sidewalk and will just get in the way of everyone
company that makes robots that would replace a person's job should be put in jail for it
I hope the robot has a good lock  .   Hungry people will be following these robot coolers  .  
Watch we talking trash on the bot getting robed but I bet he packing a self distracted button somewhere
They better install a weapons system on them  .   Lol  .   Criminals are gonna go to town  .  
3 miles an hour by the time you get your food it will be cold with flies on it LOL
The many criminals in that Cesspool City   .  will have something new to steal and rob  .   Robot jack
All we have to do is just give them a flamethrower this way it will never be stuck anymore
And then people act surprised when people in wheelchair say they can't go where they want to  .  
he didn't have to pay for it  .   I see these things get kicked all the time
So it won't take someone's job but it will make people earn less for the same job
lol sorry we are removing the labor jobs, I know you come from a long line of peons
Just another way to make less jobs for people more people can be lazy and sit on their asses
I can only imagine how many kids mess with those things, and people's food gets delivered late
Its biggest enemy will be the stairs, will all houses need ramps for these things to exist?
All fun and games until a tweaker kidnaps one and brutally murders it for its copper wire  .   lol
I hope it stays as slow as it is ️ I don't want to lose my job ️
I destroy every single one I see and I take everything the robots have  .   Fuck these robots  .  
My shit would be cold as hell waiting on that slow ass robot ! Drink all watered down!
*Perfect for delivering bombs! Then more cameras will record your life for your own safety  .   Damn  .  *
Kids can stand in front of it and block its way for the food to be delivered in time  .  
I hope this can happen at UC Berkley so I can take it to my dorm and keep it
Imagine the murderer is actually riding around disguised as the food delivery robot just to troll the police  .  
Imagine your murder going unsolved because the evidence got caught on the wheel of someone's breakfast burrito delivery  .  
Imagine the murderer is actually riding around disguised as the food delivery robot just to troll the police  .  
six kmh? Waiting time 40-50 min?? Its great idea, but waiting almost one hour to get food  .   idk
If this was in my area people would be taking them to bits and taking the orders out lol
no one does have to leave the house as it is, these are nothing more than a gimmick
Slowly we allow them into our lives, soon they will take over  .   You have been warned!
If this kind of transportation is broken on intersections or destructed, how can the problem be solved?
Humans are declared a virus (COVID)  .   You are no longer essential  .   Welcome to your new norm  .  
Technology replaces jobs, idiot  .   For example, ATM machines replacing bankers, or self-scan replacing scanners  .  
That's exactly why those type of films were made  .   Condition the masses for what's coming  .  
What a joke, what happens when a teenager decides to boot it over and steal the contents?
The way I look at it is for every robot there's a people out of a job  .  
I’d be tempted to pick it up or flip it on its back to see what happens
What is this world coming to! I personally do not think this is good for our futures…  .  
The housing estate I used to live in in Nottinghamshire that robot wouldn't last five minutes drug area
Where I live, people would go out of their way to deliberately run those things over  .   lol
I was hoping a tractor trailer was gonna run it over  .   That would have been awesome  .  
Make sure to kick these sidewalk hogs into the street where they belong every time you see them  .  
this will roll into any American ghetto and be looted and destroyed within seconds  .   prove me wrong  .  
slower than a crawling baby, holds 1 package and requires you to be home  .   this is fake  .  
Yep its gonna be stolen- can only run in rich neighborhoods  .   Its a cool idea though  .  
Looks like our packages are gonna get delivered in over the course of weeks instead of days  .  
What an incredibly fucking stupid idea  .   That thing will be trolled and destroyed every time by crooks  .  
Amazon don't do this  .   They are cute and stuff but we are gonna destroy them  .  
You mean the same way they steal and vandalize JUMP/BYRD/LIME? Yeah  .   These things would never work  .  
I can only wait until these are run over, stolen or vandalized  .   This is a pipe dream
Couriers will have baseball bats with them in case they meet the robot competitor on the way :DD
I swear to god my is stuck right now, and I don't want to go help it
I rather give some money to someone trying to make an honest living than gibe money to the robots
Whelp, this just increases the chance of robot taking over  .   When they say enough is enough  .  
The robot was doing what he wanted to do but the train killed him in front of his friends
If robots keep replacing people who is gonna have money pay for your service no one has jobs
I stole two of them, and now I use them like a skateboard and a mini car  .  
This robot would not last a day in South Africa, nothing is exempt from being stolen here :)
Like to see this robot try and get around NYC, will get run over, or stolen  .  
This is clearly a rip off of Domino's DRU  .   they didn't even bother changing the colors  .  
what if I pick up the robot and put it in the back of my truck and drive away
Pure novelty value until people start to realize their jobs are going and get angry with the technology  .  
LOL GOOD LUCK  .   How many of these will be vandalized on the street  .   What a joke  .  
Elites are taking control more than ever  .   it will get worse when robots start working stores restaurants etc.  .  
They wouldn’t have lasted long in my day  .   Graffiti, tipped upside down   .   Burnt  .  
Well I am sure on a Saturday night drinking people will be riding on these all over the town
Make sure you don't have those robots delivering food in Chicago  .   You will never see them again  .  
I like how he just admitted he’ll eliminate employees once it’s feasible to do so  .  
yeah even if you add cup holders the robot flipping it’s self over will always spill liquids lol
Porch pirates will consider this as a bonus  .   "Steal 1 package, get a cute robot for free"
Door dash has allowed me and my wife to finally pay the bills and now robots are taking that job to…
I destroyed such robots twice and took food from the robots and finally I thanked those robots for the food
Besides other normal problems the robot may encounter  .   This may mean less jobs for people if production continues  .  
I love it but who the hell just buys 2 bags of groceries? I need one that will take 10  .  
karlkarl93 No, if a bad person finds it that person can just turn it over or something pretty easily
Don’t help those robots, they take money from families because they have replaced a worker  .  
I would love to see one flipped upside down in a drainage pond or in a lake LMFAO
for wheels too Because it takes about no matter it takes to switch it off and put new ones in
Taking away jobs f that Will have to many lazy ppl doing nothing  .   As Let’s go Brandon
Isn't this the robot that turns out to be operated by some Asian sweatshop slaves for like 20 cent an hour
Bad idea  .   They will eventually get hit by thieves and get too expensive to keep fixing and/or replacing  .  
Can not wait to see the faces of all those happy customers when their jobs gets replaced by robots  .  
I live in MK  .   with these robots its on sight  .   I have put nine in willen lake already  .  
Then happy days  .   Hopefully robot accidents happens often then they might rethink and keep a people delivery driver!
So will these robots gets tickets for jaywalking? I noticed one crossing but not at a cross walk  .  
The gang-bangers in your Democrat run Hell Holes are gonna make great sport of taking these droids out  .  
these robots here in Brazil would disappear in 5 seconds and in 20 seconds would be bank robbing or drug delivering  .  
I imagine a bunch of teenagers just waiting in the bushes to jump a delivery robot to steal its stuff
Good by to another job humans get paid for no more delivery guys we will regret all this trust me
could be fixed by mounting a minigun on the top of the bot, or flamethrower~ why not both?
Those aren't self driving, I work driving them in Columbus and Phoenix, from my lap at México
100 years later   .   "I downloaded files of the mistreatment of my ancestors, you fleshes will pay!"
Will be fun when thieves learn that one Ouster lidar so nicely exposed on top of the robot costs 5000$  .  
I was literally talking to my friend about how I kind of wanted to kick one and then ran into you
This is good an all, Till the local idiot and children start stealing the product or destroying them  .  
Won’t be long before they end up in the canal with their trolleys  .   Matter of time  .  
Fine! Go that way! You will be malfunctioning in a day, you near sighted scrap pile!
Self-service tills weren't enough  .   Now we are supposed to press the pedestrian crossing button for inept technology?
In San Antonio a meth head will come to my mechanic shop n try to sell it to me for $50
All this tech and nobody thought about installing a robotic finger, for ringing door bells and button pressing !
One day they gonna use armed versions and we end up with gun battles between gangsters and delivery bots
It’s all fun and games until that thing gets hit by a car while crossing the street  .  
this is so amazing, but in Vietnam, this one just exists 30s before being dismounted even a wheel 
6 wheels is no good  .   That means 50% more friction  .   Try four wheels, or three, or even one
If Death Stranding has taught me anything it's that packages delivered by robots are guaranteed to be 90% damaged  .  
Why do they keep making these things that will never happen? Remember the drones? Time to get real
will be stolen or vandalized instantly  .   Also in my city the sidewalks are crumbling and just gone in places
Hmmmmmm  .    .  I think to some anyway, it says, "Steal Me!" "Please!"
So are they taking jobs or leeching off the government? Which one is it? Cant be both  .  
What's to stop someone from stealing the food out of it? Nothing  .   Free meal to a homeless person
Just because it has a cheap lock doesn't mean someone can't break it with a hammer in 40 seconds
NEW YORK WILL NOT ALLOW THIS, LETS BE VERY CLEAR ON THAT  .   SAYS A FORMER FEDERA WORKER  .  
It's only a matter of time before this thing carries ammo on the front lines of the robot war
I can just image the robot goes to Hooters and straight up steals the food! and takes off!
I am just gonna snag one of these up whenever I see it and start an army of them
It looks so vulnerable to vandalism  .   that antenna can be yanked off by a prankster, for example  .  
Or a bag can fit over it's Laser sensor, should sell for a pretty penny on eBay  .  
when the food you order is slower than people walking   .   also it probably don't climb hills or stairs
In the near future, self driving cars will transform into delivery personnel  .   Good luck competing with robots  .  
They want us to stay home and not interact with other people  .   " and you will be happy"  .  
Now here the biggest issue what if some a hole steals the bot is there a tracker in the product
Like many innovations looks great but I do not think they can be applied efficiently in real world delivery situations  .  
Those bots won't last one day in Houston  .   That's free food for somebody who could care less  .  
Better not order soup or drinks…… that thing was bumping like a go cart on a South Carolina side road  .  
I said the same thing  .   The opportunist going for the low hanging fruit will turn this into something bad  .  
How much will I get paid? Oh I won’t? Guess I won’t push them  .  
Japan won't need delivery Robots because the population will die of bacterial pneumonia  .   Keep wearing your masks people!
Those are a joke  .   They suck and are slow  .   Time is valuable and that's why those will not work
NOPE  .    .   I will not support this  .   It's a bad idea and will take jobs away from humans  .  
Awesome but wouldn't work in my city, not in the area I live anyhow  .   Not enough sidewalks  .  
Awesome! Shame people will try and destroy it or steal it while it's on it's way :P
THESE are gonna replace delivery drivers one day? maybe they don't need tips but they are entirely too slow
This is totally gonna steal jobs  .   Even if it is, for now, piloted by a people  .  
We knew this is coming and in future we all gonna be replaced by robots   .   which is sad   .  
this is fucking dumb  .   what is the robot gonna do when it needs to deliver an order 10 miles away
It was so funny how they introduced this robot in Europe government and then completely failed because robot don't worked  .  
Not really, they can't nor ever will do any kind of distance due to their speed and range  .  
Not enough space on the device to run them via solar  .   And fuel cell would run dry very quickly  .  
we really need to start thinking about a universal basic income or a lot of people are gonna revolt  .  
did this robot will wait for hours front of a customer door or just drop the package in the public way
Robots move to your door, saying hello  .   Suddenly brings out rockets and missiles and blows up your house  .  
Someone will trip over one, get injured, then sue and it will be the end of autonomous deliveries  .  
it isn't saving the economy, it's saving large businesses who only want more money in their pockets  .  
Nice idea until you see them in the river in Portland or bashed in on the side of Hollywood Blvd  .  
This works only in places that don´t have snowy winters  .   Or perhaps they could add caterpillar tracks on it  .  
This works only in places that don´t have snowy winters  .   Or perhaps they could add caterpillar tracks on it  .  
That would not last two minutes where I grew up kids would just steal it point blank or smash it apart
Just waiting for the news report of someone trying to ride the damn thing, or break into it  .   lol
not gonna stop someone from wearing a mask and destroying it before they take it to their destination to steal
knock it over for free food  .   companies only put these out so they don't have to pay real people
In Los Angeles that thing would be a cooler the next day in someone’s crib in da hood  .  
That things gonna have to carry a Glock in my neighborhood or it’s gonna get jacked  .  
Replace people by robots and soon there will be no one to buy anything  .   Stupidity of people is legendary  .  
If you think to put these ''amazon scout'' in Italy  .   they won't have long life ahahahahah 
If I order some food and then some stupid person sees the robot on the street and steals it then what?
He won't get a chance to self destruct, the person looting him will trash him before they leave  .  
So are the public expected to get out of the way for these things that are stealing jobs from humans?
Just wait until no one is permitted to go anywhere and there are thousands of these cruising the formerly right-of-way  .  
The cool thing is when it gives you food just throw your trash in it and it hauls it away  .  
and there's gonna be those stupid ass people that sit on top of it thinking it's for transportation
So it's just a fancy remote controlled car? That's fucking lame and I wasted my time watching this
I can almost imagine the next TikTok challenge: rob the bot! never underestimate the stupidity of (some) humans!
Any thoughts on the obesity problems facing 1st world nations  .  ? No clue  .   No flipping' clue how this happened  .  
how are they gonna keep the bums from taking them apart for parts like they do those rental bikes ?
With all the crime going on in Houston, I have to ask, is it theft-proof? I think not!
This looks nice but man I’m worried about the homeless people and the kids doing bad things to these bots
Because they are stealing peoples jobs  .   Why the hell would anyone help the robots that are replacing the American workers?
In America we couldn’t have something like this  .   Idiots would be trying to steal them or vandalize them  .  
Mask up and take whatever is in it lol  .   I would smash that thing to fucking bits if I saw one
This is why robots will attack humans  .   Humans only care about themselves it will be our doom in the end  .  
A restless teenager could start a new business aiming their air rifle at that thing taking pot shots from their bedroom window
Its worthless to everyone except the delivery company  .   U can just destroy it  .   No one is gonna buy it   .  
The thing is I like to leave a tips I am a truck driver and I believe in people not a robot
This is not gonna work! if you have shitholes that want to steal the food or the robot itself!
I love everyone saying this won't work because I literally live in a place where it's a thing AND WORKS
Oh common, just wait until these things rise up and kill us  .   Have you not seen Terminator? Just saying…
More mass surveillance opportunities? Are we being introduced to a digit sphere or are we being lulled into a digital penitentiary?
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT GOOD FOR ME or the robot secretly has lasers and shoots people with it haha joke:(
PEOPLE   .  WILL NOT LET THOS ROBOT THING GO LONG  .   THEY WILL BE VANDALIZED, BROKE, ROBBED AND STOLEN  .  
THE MACHINES HAVE WON  .   THEY NOW ARE ABOVE THE LAW AND ABLE TO DESTROY EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!
So you work from home and you are so lazy you can't be bother to get out and do shopping?
If we using this in Indonesia  .  I'm pretty sure  .  it will only last for a day, GOT STOLEN  .  
I know, I live there  .   I have lived in London too  .   Seen kids kick them in MK as well
These things have so many logistical problems  .   I wouldn't expect to have robots replacing delivery drivers for decades to come
I know it's a crime and I shouldn't but I really want to break into one of those machines  .  
Food and drinks arrive cold , stay with the people delivery person that carries a 12 volt system heating pad   .   Nice toy
"Hail to Pitt" Don't try to curry favor with me with cheap tricks such as those, robot  .  
Clowns using covid-19 as a PR stunt  .   They should be ashamed of themselves  .   These robots are pure mickey mouse  .  
Order loads of bottle of wine , stake caviar  .   then intercept it before it gets to your house  .   party robot
When I was a poor kid halve starved in the 50s that thing would have been raided for food in quick time  .  
in ilkeston, it would get broken open, anything inside it stolen  .   and the robot thrown in the canal  .  
Yeah I wonder if there armed ready to take you down in an instant EMP machine guns would be great right now
Looks great  .   But what about bad neighborhoods  .   Gangland   .   hmmm  .   don't think this works there  .    .   too fragile  .  
Ur problem  .   People can steal idiot  .   Also people can steal pick amazon bot scout then weapon may kill or protect
yea but their gonna be targeted regularly and destroyed on a daily basis from people trying to get inside it  .  
If I see that roll past me on the sidewalk I’m gonna open it and eat the food inside
wow I had only one job as a pizza delivery guy and now thanks for ruining that too  .   AI my arise
Don't know about Milton Keynes  .   But send these things on to my estate and they are definitely getting robbed  .  
Cool  .   Too bad in my area they would get smashed by vandals of they weren't stolen by meth addicts first  .  
Good the delivery robot is stupid and a hazard all around  .   I support this man, although his dog should be leashed
I see people commenting “I'm gonna ride it” and people still can’t see the problem with society ‍️
As a Door Dash Dasher, this makes me sad  .   I love delivering  .   This is just a way to replace us  .  
Whoever designed this needs to brush up on people nature  .   People really think these won't be vandalized or stolen? lol
I find that this thing is only useful in hospital and other than that, its completely non useful in the end  .  
This would never work in America  .   Right-wingers would push it over and hump it  .   We can't have nice things  .  
Dominoes makes billions a year, do you really need to be putting thousands and thousands of underpaid students out of work?
Bad idea, because they will get hijacked lmao, the world isn't beautiful and peaceful as this video trying to show
Dame straight they will never ever work period and I support those people actions This is radicchios horrible stupid invention to kill jobs
After the 1st 100 units have been kicked into the Thames or vandalized, the pizza shops are gonna think twice about this  .  
How do you keep people from stealing it (the food or the robot)? It seems like a good target for theft  .  
Just what our hard working students need  .   Freaking robots bringing them food  .   *THEY DON'T NEED HELP BEING MORE LAZY  .  *
I give it a few weeks before the robots are either, nicked, damaged or have graffiti chucked all over them  .  
And is it such a nice perfect society free of any anti-social thieving vandals or criminals etc.  .  ? Somehow I think not  .  
 the scary part here is when people will slowly lose their jobs (not all)  .   And imagine more robots in the future :(
Someone is always coming up with new technology  .   It's gonna put a lot of delivery drivers out of work  .  
I definitely want to kick over these job thief's  .   Why don't they design something useful like a toilet cleaning robot?
The only problem about those robots are that they are to small and maybe someday a car may accidentally run over one  .  
Tele Retail is so slow your food would be past it's use by date by the time it got to you  .  
Because people can't shoot back lol  .   Maybe that shit will work in cucked England, not the US  .   EVER  .  
Because people don't have weapons too right lol  .   Skynet will not go like you think it will, greedy fuck  .  
An extreme solution to a 1st world problem, being lazy (one of the seven sins)  .   In any case, bots win  .  
real progress is not that! who need that, except them?  .   just another pathetic attempt to make and save money
Pointless? These machines just negate thousands of self employed drivers and harvest their income for big business  .   Far from pointless  .  
I am guessing these are only sent to extremely low crime areas, some places they would be destroyed and contents stolen  .  
I’m guessing that’s not in Liverpool……  .  it would be found jacked up on bricks stripped of parts  .  
1 / On the toilets on wheels 2 / They will be robbed 3 / It takes 3 weeks for your parcel to arrive given the speed of the trick
What if people just start tipping them over for fun? Would they have to send out a person to reset it?
Hey un-educated un-skilled workers! It is not immigrants that are coming to "take our jobs"  .   It is robots  .  
Cons :Many would leave unemployed and if many robots replaces humans they would be unemployed and eventually everyone becomes poor or rich
And an idiot with a mask in open air picks up his food  .   what afraid the robot will breath on you?
That will be destroyed and stolen bye immoral people  .   Because we have lost the ability to be respectful in this country!
Next up: Homeless robot attacks man eating a sandwich on a park bench in order to keep delivery times on schedule  .  
I feel like people can easily hop out the car, use a screw driver to pop the lid and take the food
I don't see a version of this that does not clog sidewalks so I doubt something like this will actually catch on  .  
This doesn't help society in the least  .   Get a people that needs a job for this, screw the robot  .  
*This this stupidest, most inefficient & job-stealing bullshit I have ever seen   .   lol* *Reason **#14554334665** why California should be dumped into the sea  .  *
Taking away jobs 1 delivery at a time  .   It is pretty cool though  .   Wonder what anti-theft features it has outside of GPS  .  
The homeless are gonna love terrorizing those things  .   They’ll end up in Town Lake just like the rental bikes do
Count the hours until your job is completely replaced by AI  .   I am sure the company is constantly thinking of that eventuality  .  
This is cool and all but that thing is slow as hell, wouldn’t your food be cold once it arrives?
I've seen those dam delivery robots driving around I hate  hate them so much that I kick them over whenever I see them
If he’s crossing the street do I need to yield?? I DON’T THINK SO!!!!
but its so small it can hardly carry anything, so expect much bigger, far less cute versions once they gain acceptance  .  
This won't work on the streets of LA lol  .   Or any city  .   People are crazy they will demolish this thing   .  
If a scrawny dude can tip over the robot with so little effort, the build quality of those robots is very questionable  .  
It's the beginning of the end, folks  .   Just won't be the same as calling your favorite good-looking pizza guy  .  
What's the security like on these and what's stopping people taking the whole thing and taking what ever is in it?
Does it? This robot delivered to me first and I covered it in bacteria just before it delivered to you  .   enjoy  .  
They look stupid  .   Taking decent jobs from young people  .   Invent a toilet cleaning robot  .   Nobody wants to do that job  .  
JUST  .   AI using the delivery as a means of reading society's facial structures and grabbing data  .   NOT TERMINATOR at all (sarcasm voice)
So given the amount of people employed as Amazon and skip the dishes delivery etc.  .  , we are screwed when these become common  .  
They are great but I am sure that people will make themselves lazier than before since they depend on the robot too much  .  
Don't nobody pick at your food y'all can stop running with that dumb stuff if they do you are in a bad area
They will have built in machine guns like the ED-209 in Robocop  .   "I am sure it's only a glitch  .  "
Something like this might work in Japan but definitely not the US  .   Have you seen how immoral and unethical our people are?
Everything that is NOT cars is crammed onto the sidewalk  .   This has to change  .   Streets have to be for everyone again  .  
Less work for the delivery people  .   Would totally kick it out of my way  .   Is there a law against that? Nope
If I saw this trundling down the street, I would stick a ramp in front of it and make it do stunts  .  
Old boys will just smash that up, or steal it  .   Carnt see that’s the future especially in bad neighborhoods  .  
I am hitch a ride on that and my dog is attacking it, be like a turtle on its back2 in Glasgow  .  
The most ridiculous thing I have seen in a while  .   If you think this will work you are naive or have zero imagination
These things are gonna get stolen, ripped apart and then dumped somewhere in a dumpster  .   Free gifts and spare parts  .  
Eventually it will get tired of waiting for people and it will just toss your box from the sidewalk to your front door  .  
What's stopping someone from smashing the shit out of this thing, stealing the packages, and stripping it for parts??
Can't someone just take it? People take packages from people's front door step with a Ring clearly on the door  .  
Well obviously you have to use the app to unlock it  .   I doubt somebody would risk damage of property over a $10 food order
It takes away jobs from people  .   Not sure what's exciting about it  .   CEO gets rich, but people lose jobs  .  
Stupid idea, because of stupid humans  .   They will be stolen or damaged then the idea will be a waste of money  .  
you will soon find these in the bottom of a river, or in the bushes just like all the e-scooters and bikes  .  
sorry but that robot will never work in my city ,, probably someone is gonna steal my food including with that cute robot
Another job taken away from a people being that could be done by foot or on a bike, the future is rather worrying indeed
Hey there delivery men you’ll be replaced with this and soon fired from your jobs so hurry up and go into retirement early
That will never work you know that there are people out there that would just knock it over or tip it over just for kicks
This wouldn't work In the us either because it would be stolen or because of liability if someone got hurt because of it  .  
If we did live in a world with no "assholes" the people at the sewage works would be out of a job  .  
You just made me imagine a tornado and someone took a video and you just see the robot flying around in the air around tornado
thieves are smart enough to wear masks  .   Thieves are smart enough to steal the contents of the robot before the robot is found  .  
I haven’t seen them too much in real life, but I’ve seen them enough to not really care and just walk by
This is 1 of the silliest things that I've ever heard  .   Americans stop being so lazy and go out and purchase your food  .  
So people are laid off their jobs due to COVID and the ones that picked up delivery jobs are gonna be replaced too  .  
I am off to do some googling now, there must be some teenage YouTubes of '101 things to tease a MK robot with'  .  
camera and GPS can be very easily jammed by a device that costs £10 on AliExpress  .   So believe me, it will be stolen
If one came to deliver my food I would take the food and kiss the robot and probably bribe the company's to give me one
AI will take 50% people jobs in 15 -20 years your existence no longer needed ppl ( COVID-19 up to Covid 91) !!! Something to think about
The FedEx robot looks so top-heavy, I am worried that it would easily tip over and wont be able to deliver the packages  .  
I wonder if drivers in NJ would just run over the cute little robots  .   Either by accident or it could be on purpose  .  
omg real stupid idea lmao can think of so many ways this can go wrong especially theft, this can be a easy target lol
if they use them in my area than it would get "mugged" in five minutes either for the shopping or just for fun
With rising energy costs I know where I shall be picking up my FREE shopping  .   Wont take much to throw that in the van
Seems cool but when u realize these things are taking thousands of pictures a second and scanning the terrain it's something to think about
the kids round my end would throw stones at it  .   I'm talking like 5 - 13 year old's they scream all the time I hear them  .  
Who or what is to stop the groceries from being stolen   .   in todays climate I don’t think this will last very long
Haha you know it, either they will burn them or unscrupulous shop keepers will use them for delivering bags of smack on the side
I know this isn't in the United States because if it was then a homeless would have been attacking it right about now  .  
All the money time and technology put into this little guy and we still need a people to press the button to cross the road
I am pretty sure that thing wouldn't make it 500 feet out of the store here before someone snatched it and busted it up  .  
Would be a waste of money here in the us would be stolen vandalized destroyed hell might even see people build them for street racing
It goes slow enough  .   I don't see how it could manage travelling through a lot of snow and what if it rains?
Look how much space on the sidewalk that thing takes up! I wouldn't be a happy pedestrian  .   This thing would be annoying
The day I am walking down the street and this blue fucker is in the way I am kicking it over into the street  .  
Sounds like my neighborhood  .   Unless the thing has gatling guns and bullet proof armor, it won't last a day around here  .  
15 min? If is traffic never cross the road   .   Is take to long time to delivery Is ok if you don't hurry up  .  
It makes me sad, the other day my dad saw one that had either fallen or been pushed off a bridge  .   
Wait? You stop making my food when a robot comes? Btw that’s a horrible way to serve at a restaurant  .  
I want to keep them all over  .   I would love to see the company that developed these go under  .   What a dumbass idea
If I saw that robot, I would push it over, take a shit on it, followed by a soaking of cum  .  
People would probably pee and throw shit at this thing before it reach it's destination, and if not, probably be vandalized  .  
Literally the start of the end of the world give it a 400 or 500 years it and the army AI builds itself will slaughter mankind - so sad
As someone stated in the video "What if there was a bomb inside" this innocent food robot driving through a crowd of police!
Oh no, is this the future?  .   Not likely, how will it protect itself from people, dogs or bad drivers?  .  
I’d rather see a people being with a JOB  .   That thing won’t survive half the neighborhoods in the country anyway  .  
I’d rather see a people being with a JOB  .   That thing will not survive half the neighborhoods in the country anyway  .  
law chick me Do you really think this thing is gonna make it out of a “bad neighborhood”  .  ? Think about that  .  
So did it actually move on from that spot? I think these robots will have a very difficult time in winter here in Canada  .  
And people can  do that so you are gonna take people's jobs away with a robot humans got a quit depending on synthetics
What I am not looking forward to is the aesthetic and noise pollution that will come when the skies are filled with drones delivering things  .  
nah, I wouldn't be interested in the meal: motors, batteries, cameras, sensors and interface boards are way more valuable  .  
In my country, this bot would either stuck on potholes and speedbumps, got attacked by random passerby or forced to past a flooded road
I bet people will be tipping them over or putting stuff in the way, or straight up putting them in the back of their truck
Ridiculous! Depriving delivery drivers of work and depriving isolated elderly/disabled people of people interaction, not to mention a hazard to visually impaired people  .  
Uh, listening and spying devices designed as dual purpose and made so cute EVERYBODY LOVES THEM  .   Wake up people  .   Alexa on steroids  .  
It’s a tripping hazard! Besides in America it’s against the law for bicycles or skate boards to be on sidewalks  .  
They got some around UIC in Chicago recently and we are placing bets it won't be long till some get added bullet hole designs  .  
I remember a video of a guy that tried just that  .   I forgot if he succeeded, I will need to watch it again  .  
Don't ever move out of the way for a robot  .   We must make sure they have zero rights especially over a people being  .  
What you just saw folks is the suspect inside, getting the drugs and weapons past police, so when they get in - no charges  .  
I would absolutely love them to try and send one of those through Pitsmoor in Sheffield  .   I guarantee you would NEVER see it again  .  
More Trillionaires and more real humans out of work  .  ? And clearly Milton Keynes doesn’t have vandals or drunks living there  .
This maybe convenient   .   but if these robot's become available hundreds of delivery jobs would be gone for people depending on a delivery job  .  
No, robots do not belong on the sidewalks  .   First cars pushed people out of roads, now robots are trying to takeover sidewalks  .  
Definitely people would steal them to lol just lift them lol plus they remote control so still takes someone to use it terrible idea this one
Word on the street is this little unit as been detained and searched under the terrorism act section 43 on several occasions by Milton Keynes Police  .  
WOW I have NEVER SEEN OWT LIKE THIS BEFORE IT WOULDN'T LAST 2 MINUTES ROUND MY ESTATE PEOPLE WOULD EITHER ROB IT OR RIDE IT LOL
All part of the plan mate, they are depopulating humans right now  .   And these will be our replacements  .   welcome to the New world
My thoughts exactly it will be okay in posh and middle class areas but a rough area it will be gone in 60 seconds or less   .  
Haha  .   I wonder how long it is before the yobs steal these and all the groceries in it might be full of Jack Daniels
Don't help the robot  .   Act as if it's just any normal robot out there on the streets about to take over mankind  .  
I just love the way it waited for the bleeping before crossing  .   Pretty soon it will be on its back with the wheels gone   .  
It's sad to say this   .   but if we had this type of service in the US, it would get vandalized by idiots
How much is that cooler worth? I think in many neighborhoods it will be stolen on its own worth, let alone the freebies inside  .  
this will only fill Amazon's pockets with money, how many people will be left out of work and how many millions more poor?
Really not intelligent  .   I thought people prefer their packages delivered to their door secure and safe by another people  .   This is inconvenient delivery  .  
Humans will be assholes to this little guy  .   People will take other people's parcels when the lid opens  .   The robot will soon be our supreme overlord
This thing is taking up 80% of the sidewalk  .   I know most Americans don't use sidewalks, but come on  .   This is ridiculous  .  
Was just at Purdue and one of these cute little guys tried to run over me because the sensors didn’t catch me lmao  .  
You realize trains take like half a mile to fully stop plus the engineer would not have applied the emergency brake for such a small thing
They are new to us  .   We are still at the stage of testing them , even if we have actual robots working, they malfunction still  .  
Regarding Crowed sidewalks for robot delivery, Its OK if it runs into pedestrians as long as its not on a skate board or bike  .  
Hahaha I can see people graffiti on it in the future if company's push for it would be awesome draw a dick on it wow  .  
The news reporters said what if there's a bomb in that robot, yet it's the same crew who assisted the robot to go through
"That's got to be the easiest way to like bomb people  .  " Officers, I found your future suspect  .   Your welcome  .   Americans
‘Yo! I just jacked a FedEx robot  .  ’ This is the same guy who steals your wallet and then helps you look for it  .  
you will be amazed how many drug addicts will be stealing them and NY punishment are a joke can't speak for the other states
That thing is stealing my job as a delivery person  .   I hate them  .   People piss me off when they say "its cute"  .  
all cars will be stolen by criminals :( where is my package ???? bad idea stop making this world more broken we need people
Kind of, but it takes jobs away from humans  .   This would be better in NYC, where traveling by sidewalk is faster than by street  .  
Was waiting for a truck to come out of nowhere and just fucking decimate it, watch Steve's triple bean burrito dinner fly across the street
This is a serious issue regarding employment  .   Delivery services is one of the main employing sectors for students who work part-time to support themselves for college
I guess  .   But in Europe they just use bikes  .   Those have less of a risk of getting in an accident and tend to be faster
Delivery drivers doing themselves out of work, and what's happened to walking to the shops? This doesn't help with obesity  .   Madness  .  
Bring them to Sheffield and they’ll end up in the same place as the electric bikes, rivers, trees, hedges, bins  .  
They don't go very far  .   They move a little quicker than a fast walk  .   You could not fit a weekly shop in one  .  
Have you accounted for people? I see someone running this down, picking it up, and taking it home to crowbar it open  .   lol
Robots taking jobs away means more homeless people  .   And when people don't have money they won't use the robots  .   End of robots  .  
Someone is gonna get pissed off at one of them and smash them or something  .   Or even steal one of them  .   What a joke
Yes but a car drives 50km/h while this thing drives walking speed  .   I don't want cold mushy food when this thing finally arrives at my place  .  
Looks like a free meal on wheels also it probably takes substantially longer to deliver  .   Autonomous vehicles with fill this need not this silly thing  .  
Well  .   The bad news is these robots serve the walking distance only, for those people who lazy to walk to the next door restaurant  .  
So many people afraid of these ai machines becoming 'the norm'   .   don't worry you are not interesting enough to be shafted and replaced by a robot anyway
there is a guy with a van selling them out the back if you want one   .  he sells groceries too  .   tales from the future  .  
Can you imagine having these in London  .   it will be on fire within minutes  .   Looks really nice there, almost like a gated community  .  
10 minutes later day one in Chicago that little guy would be sprayed with at least 100 bullets, painted all over in graffiti and probably set on fire .
Now put it in a low  neighborhood, watch it get tagged up, fucked up and jacked up  .   Come up missing in action  .  
Someone has video on TikTok they got stuck on snow ,, there was 6 then the trash men were kicking them out of the way haha   .  
The only problem if this exist or delivered in my country  .   They will be gone in matter of a min after I order my food  .  
I would kick it over  .   I am not sold on robbing jobs from humans  .   Nor am I sold on delivering food to lazy tards  .  
why is he wearing a mask when he’s literally taking food out of a robot what did they package covid in there too??
"A people chaperone has to walk along side it to remote control it, if it gets confused  .  " So basically it’s useless…
the humans that wont have jobs will be the ones the used to work for minimum wage  .   The robots won't stop consumers from spending  .  
It is a gimmick for rich customers  .   The delivery fee is, no doubt, steep  .   These things will be stolen and vandalized  .  
U  .  S  .  A the only place on earth where they encourage laziness to get up and eliminate jobs for humans to survive and give it to a robot
Avoid all people contact, horrible idea  .   Ok for small items  .   If the girl scouts are selling cookies I need to go shopping! Yummy
Make people lazier so they’re more easy to overtake, brain wash and destroy if necessary…this is the beginning of the end for humanity  .  
"free food! free food!" I can predict the rate of mission failure at 100% once Antifa liberal-arts grad students and homeless people locate them  .  
Why help it when all it's doing is taking jobs from people that can work  .   Instead let's take a robot and deliver instead  .   Lol
I want one in my garage  .   You know this I it won’t be rolling out in America’s inner cities  .   Epic fail  .  
Motorized vehicles belong in the road not on the sidewalk/ pavement where they are a hazard to pedestrians and people with disabilities  .   This man did good  .  
you could also give it a claw/ lock so it could lock it's self to a bike rack while waiting to be picked up for service  .  
You seen how it only pulled half way back out the road at the cross walk like it was some kind of king shit !!! lol
What if I tape off the camera's, steal the robot and whatever is in it, sell the parts online and have a free dinner?
Yes, yes  .   Accept the delicious food from the Robot  .   Be nourished, happy, and grow fat  .   Grow fat! you tasty people  .  
Imagine cops showing more respect to a robot than humans  .   If that had been humans they wouldn’t have made it past the yellow tape  .  
fat people rightly or wrongly are associated with laziness so you show fat people advertising the robot “ hey use this robot and end up with diabetes”
Those things may be heavy but they are also rather small (low to ground)  .   I would be afraid of backing put of my driveway over one  .  
with all the jobs that will open up to maintain them, imagine these cheap assholes just paid more people to deliver single packages just like these robots
The One Time I felt same way although they might change it by how it is too  heavy and how it would fall flat on its ass
yes but what about an emp? lmao the robot and camera will be deactivated probably it will open up as well  .   but like people have emps
This video explains why the last argument, that giving boring jobs to robots will create better and more jobs for humans, is probably not correct anymore
where is Peduto and his robot lanes?! also don't forget to say NO to the proposed four mile road that would be used for PRIVATE companies
I for one have an urge to mug a robot  .   not for the shopping  .   But because of what these represent  .  is it just me?
Notice the worker loading the food into one of them robots isn't even wearing gloves  .   Are they hoping to deliver Covid-19 to peoples doors too?
Cool? Really? Tell that to the delivery drivers that lose their jobs but why would you care about real people, they don't matter!
Watched hood people vandalizing a food robot in another video  .   so don't expect to be this a step into future  .   This is non viable  .  
Lmfao ! Drive that little punk downtown late at night to deliver anything   .   He will be scrapped for parts and the goods will be stolen in no time lol
slave jobs  .   Anybody who can put together a sentence shouldn't consider working with them  .   Invest your time in a blue collar trade or technology  .  
exactly, I found a way to steal food that's why when in arguing with someone in this thread telling how to steal food they say nothing back
I would get in front of it and walk as slowly as possible, or drop a large box over it so that it couldn't navigate  .  
Just wrote a similar comment before seeing yours  .   If I were an angry local graffiti artist, I would probably write "FAT YUPPIES GO HOME"
If I saw that thing coming my way, I would be tempted to vandalize it just based on the amount of sidewalk it's taking up  .  
Good point  .   Once this product hits the market, what's to stop assholes from bringing some baseball bats and giving these guys an NYC massage?
If everyone buys grocery from home, what happens? Grocery at home, movies at home, exercise at home, work from home  .   Isolation  .  
would you use expensive gear in a dangerous neighborhood which generates not enough money? Maybe  .   Until now this is a gimmick  .  
so this thing records (and probably saves) real time video footage? I'm knocking this over if and when I see it  .   not a smart/practical delivery system 
People can steal the Kiwi Bot or kick it over -- can't they? Fucking with the Kiwi bot will be delivery people who lost their jobs  .  
it’s only a matter of time before robots attempt to over take the world  .   Haven’t you seen the documentary I-Robot featuring will Smith?
And that's why I don't like white people, but then again whatever was in that box was most likely for another white person so who cares
Genius? lmao, it will get stolen (especially in LA), plus like the guy above me said, it will take away some of our jobs  .  
In my city that cute little thing would be run over at the first intersection it attempted to cross  .   Drivers here run red lights all the time!
It's a bit scary to be honest  .   With self driving cars and robot deliveries they could combine the 2 in the future, no more postman or ups drivers  .  
Taking away peoples jobs and income with robots and automated cars  .   What could possibly go WRONG?  .    .  I DARE them to bring it in the HOOD!
These robots need cameras all around  .   I commute by bike and even if I am very careful with passing them, some situations are unavoidably quite dangerous  .  
Bro I am getting one of those I mean seriously if you see one will get the van knock it over the head and sell that shit to daydA
These things are not the future  .   Completely useless in crowded areas and potentially a danger on the road  .   This works in a laboratory environment as shown here
How is it that these things haven’t been vandalized yet? That’s a miracle: give the Oakland community a 1 on vandalism  .   Lol!
How come you have to be within eye sight of a robot drone, but don’t have to be in eye sight of a robot car?
not like someone gonna intentionally mask up and start targeting these for groceries the tech would be useless to anyone other then the company who owns this  .  
What’s stopping people from damaging the drone or stealing the drone or it’s content? What if it’s hit by a car?
Unbeknownst to most, this is the test version of delivering chemical and nuclear weapons to our enemies  .   Since everybody buys from Amazon anyway, why not?
boy not stealing  .   Just kicking, throwing, damaging it etc.  .   And I doubt the drunk hobo doing it will care about the camera and tracking  .  
If I was walking and it was in my way I would just kick it and throw it on the street , and break it for being so annoying
I give it a week before they are completely trashed after being continuously looted, people who believe this will ever be a thing are delusional  .   lol  .  
I would love to kick over kiwi bots  .   We could make a game of it, but I would kick them over on principle also  .  
An expensive system, so that Burger may cost you $20  .   not to mention all of the robots that are damaged, or destroyed by overserved college kids  .  
Well, I can see a lot of homeless people are gonna be eating better! and they can eat and listen to music before running away  .  
I use to live near Westheimer/ s Dairy Ashford and that’s a busy area  .   Lots of accidents  .   I could definitely see issues for that bot  .  
seems pretty trained  .   Even under fear it didn't panic  .   I see you have already chosen to side with the soulless machine though   .   Lol fuck that robot
Yes but I live in a small town in Canada and there are rarely sidewalks and a lot of snow most of the year  .   We still need drivers!
Yeah right, it won't survive the first day at work! Someone will pick it up and put the whole thing in the trunk of their car  .  
They are cool little robotics, but they are taking job's from people who depend on the same job to put food on the table for the kids  .  
Does the food stays hot by the time it gets to the customer maybe 1 delivery will make it out of 1 billion and only the robot might arrive not the food
So many crimes are unsolvable because of disturbance to the crime scene  .   Whichever police are in charge of maintaining the crime scene should be fired for gross incompetence  .  
This is the US in one video… if 4 dudes in bandanas had pulled up and stolen it right after it left the crime scene, would’ve been perfect…
It might work in a town like Boise  .   But out in the wildlands of San Fran, the snatch and grabbers would be taking these left and right  .  
"You asking me for a raise? I can replace you with a robot!" *Replaces the people with a robot* Those robots are pretty cute though  .  
That "maybe" is the problem  .   With all the lawlessness in 2023 going on, I don't think the urban community is ready for this Concept is great though
I am from Hull and spend a lot of time in Milton Keynes , and told people about these robots  .   They all think I have lost my marbles  .  
You mean most of the UK lol If we saw this as kids we would steal it, or take it's wheels for a laugh and leave it there
This thing is cool but man I hope this thing doesn't screw over delivery drivers  .   Think about all the jobs that could be taken by things like this
its like porch pirates can just take the whole blocks packages in 1 take  .   fantastic  .   This has to be a joke? People cannot be this naive  .  
Doesn't look like it could hold many packages  .   what if I am not home does it place it in my driveway (for the whole neighborhood to see?)
How easy is it to rob this delivery guy??? No need for a weapon, just crack the lid, nab the loot and stroll away  .  
this is four months late but where they are testing is less than five minutes away from my high school and they almost RAN ME OVER they are taking over
These delivery robots will eliminate the need for the following Pizza delivery drivers Door dashers Ship drivers Eventually Amazon delivery vehicles Ups delivery vehicles FedEx delivery vehicles No drivers needed
So if you are a parent with a stroller or someone in a wheel chair are you meant to just kick it over onto the road to get by?
They all come with this bs excuse of “pollution” solving problem when in fact is pure corporate greed to get people driver out of game get all the money
Not going to lie  .   I was a more than a little disappointed to learn that they weren't autonomous self-driving robots, but rather just simple remotely operated vehicles  .  
Wow a great unprotected machine someone can walk over and beat it with a metal bat and or crowbar  .   Now tell me many how many of these got destroyed?
Except it can only do a single delivery each trip making it much more inefficient than a driver who can stop off at several homes that are near one another  .  
How long before morons start attacking them, it is bound to happen, some people will try to destroy anything, especially as they are carrying something of interest  .  
 your right but robots was supposed to dodge things that is in their path and it’s hard for them to make their way to destination and later head back
Just throw a wood in front of the wheels  .   Robots will replace Dara   .   So long until no one is working and no one has money to buy anything  .    .  
Stupidity at its finest wise up the future needs to be people not robots!
I like it but that thing can kill you by accident bad idea Who cleans that thing and if that thing comes in my driveway I’ll run it over
These are examples of the danger of AI  .   Take jobs that increase resentment crime against self-drive vehicle  .   Will the robot get armed with deadly weapons? You bet  .  
bullshit: how stupid we have become  .   'progress' without push back  .   who wants a variety of robots running on our sidewalks and up our stairs to our houses?
The robots blocking the handicap ramps are the big problem  .   Clearly we just need humanoid robots walking around so they can step out of the way, problem solved  .  
It is locked though so it might be harder to get into it  .   Even so, it is still possible I guess for people to steal it  .  
instead of dropping off their unwanted baby at the hospital, they will just order something from Amazon and when the robot comes, they will put the baby inside  .  
It’s cool things to do with that but I can sense it will disappear as soon as people want to steal  .   Cops will have to follow robberies  .  
I don’t see it like very functional…I mean, it is very slow and it is terrestrial…why don’t try with a drone delivery or something really innovative?
I still don't trust it  .   One day when that thing is attacking you after a short circuit from water you will understand he just scans the neighborhood planning, plotting
In a perfect world this would be great  .   Unfortunately there are thieves everywhere and drunken teens ready to destroy anything that alerts their pea brain sensors  .   Including this little fella
They can never replace us  .   They keep trying and failing  .   In a busy restaurant during rush times you think this is time practical? Its a non profitable gimmick  .  
ever see the episode where he's worried about the batteries dying on the cellphones? Unless they are getting a constant charge or battery bank swaps it won't work  .  
You really need to make it more visible  .   And maybe add sound  .   Right now it almost blends with it's surroundings  .   It is now practically invisible to drivers  .  
What, people kick robots and push them over? Now, who might she be talking about? Perhaps you can tell me, Boston Dynamics engineers????
Why don’t they just use drones instead? Like to me these robot cars are completely unreliable, they always get stuck or end up getting hit by cars  .  
just another drug smuggling device  .   How stupid do you have to be to think those would word  .   Go use these in the city and see how long they last  .    .  
Everyone should refuse to use any sort of robot  .   Including self check outs  .   You can’t beat people interaction you also can’t beat jobs for people!
if they fail, what does the people that ordered those do? they would complain, it's even more painful if you are the one ordering and then they fail
real possibility, it has smaller wheels to so it can probably be tipped of by something as small as a volley ball  .   anyway, excited to see people friendly designs
I do food courier  .   robots WONT happen in this life time  .   too many knacker kids in our UK cities to give theft and rob them  .   it looks too insecure
they would give it a knife or a gun and send it out to rob or take out their rivals   .   " Roadman robbing rover"
I just don't see this working out in certain places  .   What happens if someone tires to kick it or damage it in some way? It looks slow too  .  
This is awakening a primal fear in me because I definitely feel like I could take it down one on one but amazon doesn't seem to be worried about pesky humans
So how is this joker gonna navigate at the part of the sidewalk where you have to climb a 6 inch wall to avoid the non existent side walk???
Not funny, all manufacturing will soon be robotic, all waitresses and food delivery, Walmart self checkout  .   where will people work??? This is far from funny
here comes the terminator it's no joke  .   when we don't have any money we can't pay your robot! humans are replacing themselves  .   we are fools  .  
as much no Hijacker, cars run over them, teens jerks messing up  .   hungry homeless, conservative Karens, and Police, they will be okay  .   Maybe!!
Except that the carts are people operated  .   The drivers still exist  .   Just remotely  .   They are just not exposed the  physical dangers of Houston traffic, or nefarious customers  .  
4 years later and it hasn’t even come close to replacing the jobs  .   This is for niche places like in cities but anyone where else this wouldn’t be efficient
Look at this long term it’s just another gimmick that will encourage people from going out to normal shops if this continues people will not even leave the house any more
Also, that would not last here in California  .   Someone would pry open that thing and run off with the goods  .   Heroin use here makes people do the worst things  .  
I don’t see these going anywhere  .   Very cool not very practical  .   They go like 2mph  .   “Your food will be there in 2  .  5 hours  .   Plus charging time  .  ”
These robots won't make any profits anytime soon  .   How much is the upfront cost of one robot gonna take paying off  .   It's almost the same Uber Lyft dilemma
security of the robots should be make a priority  .   if these robots just going on in a city like that, they will be smashed empty robots by the end of it
Meanwhile, down the road in my lovely town Luton, an entire fleet have been emptied, had their wheels nicked & been left on bricks !!!!!!!
These things came and gone in my city (Madison, US)  .   Turns out the weather and subsequent maintenance doesn't make them cost effective  .   Also, people mess with them  .  
That's a lovely sidewalk  .   What happens when there's construction going on, and it has jump off that 10 inch curb  .   And does it come with a snowplow option?
Nah, they will just throw the whole $20,000 robot in their truck, take the packages, dismantle it, and sell it to a metal recycling place for a few bucks  .  
That stupid fucking toy is gonna run the streets - I cant wait to fuck with it - throw it in the river or hang it in a tree - maybe toss it into traffic
that isn't true  .   I would just kick the thing over  .   I don't think the world is gonna convict me for kicking over your job stealing stupid robot  .  
Don't you care about all the people you are leaving unemployed at all??? Don't you mind about the world your leaving to your own kids???
Yeah sounds great, especially for the whole bunch of people who just see this rolling down the street and get a free meal off of it just by opening the lid!
They are making these things illegal on the sidewalk in San Francisco  .   And I can't see it working in NYC either, the sidewalks are crowded with people in Manhattan  .  
Ok sure  .   Lemme see this on 98th Ave in Oakland some Crack head is gonna kidnap it and make its sex toy or adopt it as pet to talk to  .  
1  .   Willie Nelson should be ashamed to promote automation  .   2  .   We are gonna kick it over , spray paint it , put it in our trunk and chuck your robots into a lake  .  
Idiotic idea and the starters knew it  .   It was just a way to cash in from rich morons  .   When money was made, the main guy Allan Martinson just walked away  .  
I can see people who deliver sabotaging these robots with glue mines  .   Spray paints, paint balls, jammers and who knows what else  .   These robots will need a body guard  .  
it wouldn't last five minutes in London  .   Kids would kick it, people would steal the food  .   it would get trashed  .   What we would need is a weaponized version  .  
Why not just cook food at home, with ingredients from your fridge? No carbon emissions or electricity being used there, or robots that people will obviously steal and chop for parts
Shoehorn in the unacceptable, using a "good cause  .  " How many weeks until robots from the same provider are patrolling the streets and skies 24 hours a day to enforce lockdown?
Not many estates in the UK will be a safe place for these, and it is getting less safe!! Anyone ever seen a child sitting on one for a ride?
In what alternative reality do people live in? LOL  .   there is no way this is ever gonna be viable, these things will be looted and trashed in a week  .  
Eh, say if the warehouse was a mile away from your house, and this thing was going 3mph it would take 40/45 mins round trip to deliver one parcel Is it worth it?
Target practice, a kid with a BB gun can take out that camera and then what? lol   .  this is the most insanely stupid idea I have seen yet  .   Next  .  
robots aren't gonna take hardly any jobs in the next 5 years  .   That being said, I would happily kick over these little robots because they look like a stupid idea  .  
I could see someone either crashing into it, or wanting to steal the food inside of it within a short period of time, plus it's battery life and range is low
Robots  .   Precisely what's killing jobs in the US, not immigrants, and these robots are created by us citizens: Americans killing Americans jobs   .   learn and weep, Trump  .  
Wait just a minute This is a worse version of something that already exists Look at Door Dash's design  .   it can climb stairs, and its WAY SMALLER this, is horrible  .  
Won't be that way for long, I promise you  .   Companies are pouring billions into artificial intelligence  .   A lot of jobs done by humans will be wiped away in 10-20 years  .  
wow he is so  .   quick! at this speed I can get my food delivered in few days lol  .   And I thought regular delivery guy is slow  .   its not viable  .  
They are crap, here's one that spent 5 minutes at a quiet T junction, then spent another 5 minutes at a Zebra crossing, that was 10 minutes to go 20 yards
I bit all those delivery vehicles from one person Order something  .   Thinking  .   It will come  .   Lol But just get  stuck with the others in the snow   .   I love technology  .  
"Why have a 2 ton car deliver a 2lbs burrito  .   Translates to: " Why pay a people that needs money to live, if we can have a robot do it for free"
I saw the same drone on Queen St East in Toronto near Broadview Ave and a lady was walking her dog and the dog saw it and went APE SHIT  .   Totally freaked out  .  
its a cute little thing  .   But its trying to take away people jobs  .  it doesn't look like its successful though, and it wont get far without someone stealing it in my city
oh man I like your choice but I will do two things if it's not cute it will be snap out of existence or if it's cute I will try to hack program
Crime scene? Don't mind my wheels picking up the tiniest amount of DNA evidence that could be found, now your case is ruined  .   Killer laughing when he knows it worked  .  
First thing I noticed  .   Everyone is either too busy or lazy to walk to the shop  .   I can't even imagine having to  rarely' on a fucking robot to bring me things  .  
I am sorry but I would rather have a people being deliver my packages that a damn machine  .   Machines will never replace humans just like people machines will eventually break down and die  .  
Love your videos, even though this robot doesn’t go off campus, I hope they don’t one day get rid of our people uber drivers and grocery delivery services  .  
Lets face it ,where I live you can guarantee they are gonna be in the streams, pit ponds and disused railway embankments, empty! Along with the endless shopping trolleys  .  
I don't believe any of this   .   easy to program a robot to move a couple feet and open a door   .   this company will go down in flames once they are investigated  .  
Curbside pickup jobs are the worst  .   Forcing employees to do this extra BS for just one customer is so not sustainable  .   They won't keep anyone if they keep offering this stuff  .  
When introduced and massed the new models will be made by Boston Dynamics and have machine guns loaded on top with a security drone flying overhead to thwart the thieves.   Welcome to the future.  
Also won’t work because the gps is sometimes wrong and we need to figure out  .   Robots can’t think outside the box  .   Gps says you arrived and not there yet  .  
Well it looks like this crime seen just got a lot bigger, might as well attach a new roll of yellow tape to the robot so he can tape things off as he goes  .  
what makes you think these would be any different? they are certainly not gonna bring you the weekly shop  .   you could use delivery or just-eat for the exact same but people service  .  
then the local chavs kick it over and stamp on it to get free stuff lol also for free taxi order food from somewhere and sit on the top and it will drive you home
the kiwi bot appeared like someone legit duct taped a Coleman cooler with some stickers onto a sick looking rc car XD and I almost think that the whole recognition on the camera was a lie
we need to tax this enough to support the people families and society it will displace very little profit should come from the destruction of peoples lives and livelihoods   .   this is AI Go Tartans!
Won't be long until the dealers start using these , they will be easy to spot due to the pack of sniffer dogs stalking them , I can already imagine that episode on David Attenborough
I hope your job doesn't include delivery otherwise you better start thinking of a new career another person's job gone! I would have tipped it over to see if it could right itself
Look Up what happened to Hitchbot and other flying Delivery drones  .   It does not Take Long for those Things to get vandalized too   .   Just a sad world without Respect for other people's property  .  
This is so stupid  .   It can’t even cross a street lmao  .   All my frozen stuff is now Luke warm while it bakes in the sun for 6 hours waiting for the clear  .  
He move so slow it will take him all year to deliver our packages  .   this is equivalent to a man walking through the neighborhood (no van) going door to door delivering packages (one by one)
The courier can not spit on it unless the robot was designed to do so  .   There are still people who make the contents though, and they do all kinds of things  .   ALL KINDS
Look it’s not the trains fault  .   The engineer clearly cannot see the robot so there’s no way that he’s gonna stop for a stupid food delivery robot
no they wont  .   these robots will not work, at all  .   They will get stolen left and right  .   The robots are only testers  .   There will be robot cars delivering the food  .  
what if someone opens a truck's back door right in front of this thing while its delivering food? Will it go around the truck knowing it's a trap or ride into it?
Why isn't this this just a car? It's way too big to navigate sidewalks  .   Owning the data on navigating sidewalks must be worth a lot more to them than delivering pitas  .  
Cool until they are reprogrammed to shoot to kill, which no doubt is their next step in the global depopulation agenda  .   The insane globalists always use university towns for their sick experiments and research  .  
The pavement is for people  .   The road is for motorized vehicles and that is where they should all be  .   Good luck with the traffic  .   We should all be walking to collect items anyway  .  
ice magic Those jobs starship brings  .   Robot packers  .   Who were likely delivery drivers or clerks before  .   Sorry not easily excited by shiny objects  .   Particularly when they come with a huge societal cost  .  
what I mean is when they cross the road to get to the other side and maybe the cars waiting for the red light to go green won't see it and might run it over  .  
it wont work  .   too expensive  .   too unreliable  .   need to bring the cost down  .   and need to perform better than a people being  .   if you are a business owner you would understand  .  
Lol I would sit on for a free ride no doubt; hell NYC buses are damn unreliable  .   But in NYC that would be taken for parts and the food would be lifted in 5 mins  .  
so they thought of everything to keep the food safe and deliver autonomously  .   unless there's a crosswalk? how long was it sitting there waiting for help??! seems like a massive oversight
Another job lost for a people that could have done this job on a bicycle or on foot  .    .   how the future scares me the rich get richer and the common people lose their jobs to machines
Bruh this is fake, someone is probably gonna steal it by the time it gets to your house and won’t it run out of charge by the time it comes to your home
No crimes for disabling a robot  .   The potential crimes of injuring a pizza guy outweigh the benefits  .   A robot is valuable and can be disassembled for parts  .   It's a different situation altogether  .  
I would like to believe that one person ordered all these, they only ordered once but when food didn't arrive they just kept ordering and all the poor robots got stuck in the same place  .  
That's funny cause that's something nobody seems to care  .   When everyone get replaced by robots  .   Who will use this piece of crap?? No body is gonna be able to buy anything
They are making sure less people have jobs (less delivery workers) so more of the profits goes to the company owners instead of people who live and work in the area  .   Bad for  local economy  .  
what if somebody steals it? Cover your face so the camera won't see and then dismantle it and sell the parts  .   That's the problem was robots they can get stolen or attacked easily  .  
That's a double fault if the police didn't secure it  .   If it is able to move unfettered through some crime scenes, it could really eliminate some evidence of the crime, and obviously the company is at fault for releasing a buggy robot  .   Really grinds my gears  .  
this also means that we won't get to see a person who would smile, hand a drink, say thank you  .   Maybe it's just me missing a people connection for the past 10 months  .  
Please get a good education or you will be replaced by this crap !!! Scary or am I just getting old and obsolete? Starting to believe WEF, too many useless eaters !!!
Been loads of videos of the trials of these on YouTube, they have trackers so won't be stolen but they will get destroyed in certain areas  .   Poor delivery men losing their job to a robot
I can think of quite a few areas in the uk where that thing would last 5 minutes on the streets before it’s either used as target practice or ends up being kidnapped for spare parts!
That would never work here  .   Half the crosswalks lead to nothing (literally no sidewalk) and a huge percentage of the others are broken (never change when you push the button)  .   It is our secret shame  .  
don't tip the robot, tip a people delivery driver! (Yeah I know he was joking but come on! People actually put money inside of that little first  .   I am tired of seeing it  . )
Why is this thing allowed on a pedestrian sidewalk? I can't see this working in NYC, the sidewalks are overcrowded with people  .   Legislators in San Francisco are working on legislation making it illegal  .  
They hit campus just as I left campus dining  .   From what I have heard from my old Co workers they were nonplussed about it  .   Bots getting stuck, drinks spilling, people screwing with it, etc  .  
I was thinking the same thing  .   As neat and unique as it is, I worry about the people losing their jobs  .   The rich will get richer I guess, too bad for the working citizens  .  
I just saw a video of one getting run over by a train  .   Also I’m an Uber eats delivery driver and people are being nicer to these robots than they are to me  .   Damn  .  
As others have commented on, these things won't last two minutes after dispatch in many areas of the UK due to the amount of   .   how can I put this politely   .   not very nice individuals  .  
It's great technology but it's a shame this technology will be putting more and more people out of work, new technologies are the future but going forward there will be a lot less jobs available  .  
I saw one of these stuck in the bushes today and some workers cutting the bushes out of it's wheels trying to free it  .   Looks like it got tired of the sidewalk and went off roading  .  
This is the stupidest thing ever to come out of Amazon  .   I mean the _letting absolute strangers have complete access to your house_ was ridiculous, but it had some merit  .   This is just a joke!
Well  .   That's just gonna make porch pirates become hacking nerds  .   Also, I would t  .   I mean, my stupid friend would totally try to ride that B after too many tequila shots  .  
What if there are roads without side walks, how will the robots manage to get through those? In certain city there will be sidewalks with cracks in them, what if the robots gets caught in those?
This will fail  .   Air Drone delivery is the way to go  .   The problem is that these robots will get in the way of people on the sidewalks and they are too slow to drive on the streets  .  
The heck? How is that profitable over a car  .   A car driver can make many more deliveries faster  .   Looks like a stupid novelty if there is a control room full of people driving toy RC cars  .  
If a car does hit it, it's almost the equivalent of saying that of a person(s) walking in a crosswalk  .   Most likely then ( at fault ) the driver was not paying attention while operating a vehicle  .  
As it is a commercial vehicle on a public footpath I do hope the company is paying a tax or license to use our public footpaths  .   Imagine 10 million of them delivering, our paths will not be usable  .  
i cannot imagine this would be allowed on the streets of uk ,the electric shock part i mean ,i  .  e  .   what if a couple of young children thought they found a toy and tried to play with it
Cool deal let's see it ship a rolled up mattress or a box of chewy  .   I work for fed ex and honestly say this will never work or at least with the level of tech we have now  .  
Then you don't want to read my comment lol ! " Lmfao ! Drive that little punk downtown late at night to deliver anything   .   He will be scrapped for parts and the goods stolen in no time lol "
Pineapple Gamer or you whip out your pry bar after shoving a shielded box/bag over it  .   you can innovate all you want but a couple thugs with a tire iron and tin foil can rip this thing off  .  
We all gonna end up in floating chairs, fatter than bears b4 winter time  .   Get off your ass and walk to the dinning hall so you can exercise for a while  .   There's an idea  .  
I have just clicked through to here from a Buzzfeed video on another food delivery robot in San Francisco, which is smaller, faster, and can climb curbs  .   I am a bit disappointed by this Marble  .  
robots should help people be aside with not taking place f humans to turn them from poor to homeless   .  sometimes inventing facilities to people actually would b more like a curse on the long term nd boring  .   rip
Sad fact, it will never service low-income communities and high crime rate areas  .   Low crime rate and upper middle class communities , then you are talking business  .   Offenders in these areas will just be teenage pranksters  .  
I am about to start Door Dash and I was hoping to make it my full time job, I really hope we are not taken out of the equation too soon! I wanted to bike as a job!
yeah, but you would have to do that many more times compared to wheels  .   Besides, tracks have a greater chance of getting stuffed with things like snow, which can cause them to pop off the robot  .  
Its not practical to use these smaller size wheel runner drones, too slow for the highway/streets, too bulk for side walks, too limited in range  .   Unless they meet up with a vehicle to primary average range  .  
People do all those things in Milton Keynes as well  .   A starship guy told out to watch out for him recently as he had to retrieve one of these guys stolen by a guy who lived in a tent  .  
How many jobs will this eliminate? Where will it stop? Will all of those UPS, FedEx, and Amazon drivers lose their jobs? Let's consider the consequences before we leap to the next big thing  .  
Most Cities and HOAs wouldn't allow this on their sidewalks  .   Businesses to operate on the sidewalks  .   imagine tons of companies doing this  .   Now shipping on the roads and the sidewalks  .   Not sure this is the solution
So what happens when the robot meets a person in an powered wheelchair? Who's getting off the pavement onto the road in order to get by? I would knock this damn thing off without a seconds thought  .  
it's super low efficiency though  .   it only carries one person's meals and to serve just one customer at one time it's pretty inefficient  .   pathetic  .   it should have 4 or 5 boxes and an efficient routing algorithm  .  
but what if I hack it and get the food? What if I hit it with a hammer and get the food? What if I go to the store and pick it up like a normal people being?
Well I know what kind of music that robot listens to  .   "Move, Bitch, get out the way, get out the way Bitch, get out the way  .  " Assuming that was a female dog  .  
It's nice but will replace thinking people that you can interact  .   The worst is that these robots will replace people, means HIGHER unemployment  .   These Robots will deliver Bombs to your house too  .  NO THANK YOU!
if the siren is disabled first  .   There's always some right smart*rise somewhere who will figure out how to hack them just like all those out there online who routinely hack all manner of wireless network connected stuff  .  
Something tells me we will be seeing some run over burgers!   .   There will be entry of tore up bots on the road  .   Next they will be telling us about recycling bot parts & where to drop them off  .   Lol
Does the robot drive by without stopping and say attempted delivery resident not home? Does it throw your packages??!! If not I don’t want it I’ll stick to the authentic fed ex experience
Real cute  .   Just remember for every one of those things you see there's an out of work people sitting at home  .   just say no to Ai  .   One step closer to Skynet  .   One step closer to unemployment  .  
Can we have a video where a dog pee on it!!!? At the end there will be no more jobs and no people that buy anything  .   Therefore companies will defeat themselves at the end  .  !!!
Try that in Yorkshire and half of these things will be jacked, or kicked for parts for folks to chav their motor! Great idea though  .   And they look like scaled down taxis from the original judge dredd movie!
That wouldn't last 2 mins where I live (BIRKENHEAD) it would be smashed up or robbed am ashamed to say  .   How good would of these been during the lockdowns, maybe that's where the idea has come from  .   Fantastic
Hahaha this is class can't imagine one being around my estate near Manchester kids will launch it or tip it over can't be trusted I would love see hundreds of these delivering stuff in the future though be hilarious  .  
People are so deceived  .  this is so fake  .   AMAZON puts fake stuff out like this for headlines only  .   It is part of marketing strategy to lie about far fetched things  .    .  like the delivery drone  .  totally fake  .  
Well, this is pretty useless  .   Wait a few years to have the first self-driving cars on the road, and I am sure there will be self-driving delivery vans as well  .   This company is a dead born child  .  
many said that robots would replace humans and many didn't believe  .   now robot are replacing people and still many don't believe  .   I work for door dash and with these new rob these new robots I may loose a job
I know it is so cute I just want it and gently squish it by hugging the little robot and taking it home with me  .   can you imagine yourself having one of these rolling around your in your house full of cuteness
The delivery robots are cool, but seriously I don't know where we are gonna get all the sidewalks needed for this to work  .   American roads are notorious for having crappy, inconsistent, and often altogether non-existent sidewalks  .  
I suppose it's appropriate to have robots in Toy Town  .   I wonder how many jobs will be lost by the use of these, then who would be able to afford to use them  .   We shall see in time  .  
These won't work in apartment complexes due to stairs  .   What if there are other issues like nobody is home, its raining, notes on the door with specific delivery instructions then how's that algorithm gonna figure it out?
I need to get out of my house and meet people  .   Need to interact with people beings  .   Don't want no robot near to me at all  .   God created us for community and fellowship with other humans like myself  .  
You are idiots! This bot won’t get stolen, but people’s trucks are  getting yanked for their catalytic converters! You people are completely out your minds  .   This is the state of people’s priorities!
The uk doesn't have these delivery robots, the britshit nation are thieves and would rob them like they did the rest of the world  .   They have a poverty rate of 20%  .   Do you really think these bots would survive there?
I have been there many times, next to them, encouraging them to go at the right time but  .   Unfortunately they are programmed in a way that standing next to them and doing gestures would actually get them to stay back lol
I am not sure they have replaced any delivery people  .   They have replaced a walk to the local shops  .   Good for the minority who have difficulty getting out (or at the moment, self-isolating) but they do tend to encourage laziness  .  
If they came to Scotland they would be stolen, people would sit on them for a ride or kick the hell out of them  .   They probably couldn't drive through the snow either  .   Nice though if they did work here  .  
Exactly what I thought  .   These people are too fat to walk to the shop so they get a robot to do it  .   Then because they have no exercise they get ill and claim benefits  .   Aka you even seen the movie Wall-E?
There go many more jobs but the big shot still make their money it would be in your best interest not to use these services but I know people will still use them even if it kills the people economic base smh we are done
cute and efficient  .   but if there is a crisis for this robot stealing someone's job i would gladly kick one of these  .  , or if you make a version that flies it will be even more fun to play with target shooting
Lol, I love how everyone is clapping  .   All of their jobs are gonna be gone, and this is the beginning  .   It's a very very silent "singularity"; to the point that people are actually clapping lmao
I see the need for a new law  .   Intentionally hindering or blocking the forward progress of a robot delivery system  .   Don't chill my dinner  .   In da hood they be tying a rope from that bot to shopping cart  .  
Good luck with that in suburban NJ, the pizzeria is 5 miles away  .   A car and a people is needed to deliver the pizza to your door  .   These robots are not street legal and they should not be on the sidewalk  .  
I predict that they will be redesigned a few times fairly early on as people steal them and post how to quickly bypass its built-in security  .   I can imagine them being like cars stolen in the 1970s then found a block away but stripped  .  
I don't think they will take over the job because of, they are kind of easy to run away with and could be a hazard like you could put a bomb in it and send it to a populated area and detonate it 
To be able to do delivery as a business, they have to out thousands of those on the street  .   Would city allow may of those in our sidewalks? They need to think more realistic  .   It only carries one small order  .  
Forget about starship, if I was homeless like I was 5 years ago and a wee robot passed me, I would be picking it up opening it up and having a lovely dinner that night  .   It will never work , who u kidding
25 years ago: In the future robots will deliver your groceries or take out to your door  .   But within a couple of years the theft will be so rampant the process will stop  .   Check that last prediction in a couple of years  .  
where was security? that robot was filming private property  .   I think it was also filming the airfield which makes this a homeland security issue  .   I hope the robot is carrying ID and doesn't mind being "detained for being suspicious"
Those things are a pain in the rear   .   when they’re at the crosswalk  .   they go n go back like playing chicken with cars   .   causing a traffic jam   .   seriously people do we really need them even Johnny 5 says   .   NO
Saw these in action yesterday and I got chills  .   The future is coming fast  .   Now get out of the way of the food bot! It needs a voice in a sharp New Yorker voice, "Move it! Walking' heah!"
What's the point in even gonna college at that point if you support driving cars and robots taking over what keep us humans active? The more we do in society is the more we learn & knowledge on every little thing is key  .  
I live in MK but have never used this service because I go out to do my local shopping  .   The only thing bad about it is hearing people telling you how bad the place is, but they really don't have a clue  .  
how can you promote such kind of things, that are not good for our future and ecology? Also, all those approving comments seem to be posted buy a 'troll farm', hard to believe that 95% of the viewers thinks this is fantastic  .  
Lol So have you heard of theifs Does the LID LOCK!!??? I can imagine a group of kids or thugs just nicking these or messing about with then!?? It's not a great idea if you ask me
Great idea during the current lockdown situation, likewise with the drones delivering medical equipment to the isle of wight, but do we want it when life finally return to normality? Don't want to see and hear drones overhead every day and night  .  
Robots already started getting an advantage! And the crazy who think robots are something normal too! They actually created the robots, the antihuman's crap! No normal people having normal human's thinking need any robots! They need other humans!
This will undoubtedly open a black market startup for robots to steal from other robots  .   If you want something done right you do it yourself  .   They will do everything better though, and all with little to no need for assistance or oversight  .  
Awesome! Another way for Society to get less Social  .   No wonder people are getting more depressed, more anxiety, fatter, single, poor social skills, poor communication skills, and just being all alone! Not all technology is good!
A "Robot" that needs a pilot? lol It's an RC Vehicle  .   Also Cost savings = Low wages, asshole boss, shit working conditions and no tips  .   I will be sure kick every single one I see on to its side  .  
Well  .   Those robots don't have AI's to warn people that's its illegal to interfere with its delivery's  .   " Citizen, you are required to wait till police arrives to arrest you for damaging me  .   Comply or face more jail time"  .  
Ahhh so sweet and naive  .   In my city these things will be smashed, bashed and trashed  .   Just like the rental bikes a company tried to set up  .   These robots will go the same way in rivers and up trees and on fire  .  
People saying this is cute lack oxygen supply to their brains like there isn't enough death traps on the road from pushbike riders and people just staring at their phone now we have to dodge giant metal boxes what spaz thought this was a good idea
great invention? hahahah leaving in aside the fact that someone will have no job because he has been replaced by a machine, these toys are very slow, easy to be stopped in his way, and not realistic at all  .   come on  .  
they have just appeared near mine, co-op are using them in Trafford, they are all over the place, cars are breaking suddenly, drivers are expecting them to drive out in front of them, they will definitely cause an accident sooner or later  .  
I wouldn't like to be the poor sad who has to clean all the dog filth and squashed worms and slugs off the wheels of those things  .   And if one of them got in my way I would soon shove it right out the way!
Rage against the machine  .   Smash the robot killers  .   Just wait until they are rolling down the streets with a machine gun attached and firing at YOU ! As motorized vehicles they should be on the road not on the pavement/ sidewalk which is for humans !
This would work great in the Netherlands  .   You could go everywhere on foot and bike lanes  .   US streets are a lot harder to navigate  .   That futuristic street is the street in the Netherlands  .   Only different colors  .   They are in the wrong country  .  
These things are gonna be vandalized so fast by all those unemployed delivery people  .   Forget your package being stolen off your door step, its gonna be run over, set on fire, shot, then thrown into a sewer and then stolen  .  
This only means an American or Our Brothers and sisters around the globe will not have a Job  .   What do these rich people think will happen when peep can't work for a living wage because all the JOBS are done by robots or ship seas
I agree , people say cute adorable , bigger picture is self service I am supermarkets has put people out of a job ,these will start to put drivers out of a job ,technology is useful to assist humans ,not make us surplus to requirement   .  
I remember a show on Netflix called "Love, Death, Robots" and one of the episodes there's robots just like this that tries to kill a innocent lady just because her sentient Roomba got pissed at her and her dog  .   We gonna die
This is amazing, its Star Wars  .   Wonder if they will deliver Rizla and a pot noodle at 2am? This will be a thing only for well to do areas  .   People in other areas will set it on fire  .   It will need to be armed  .  
If that happens, then they will put guns on these Robots to shoot criminals Dead !!! We can't let ANYTHING stop "Progress", now can we ??? Even if it means murdering some Humans to Save the Robots !!!
Follow My Lead If this company get off the ground they will be done for as soon as they are sued for ADA violations  .   I mean, It's a remote control cooler on wheels that can't cater to people with disabilities the way a people can  .  
good idea but also gotta think of how to avoid thieves, I mean, they won t steal the food but the entire robot lol!   it has a tracker but unless this robot flies for his life they are gonna crash him to pieces
One of the most stupid ideas  .   IF porch pirates have no problem stealing packages off the front of my house, just think how much more easy it would be to just steal this robot  .   Easy to toss a faraday blanket over it to foil cellular and tracking
Food delivery robots I would be worried about AI, what if they start consuming the food! Then just like us, they will be required to show a photo of the dropped off order! If a drink spills on or inside the unit- it could short circuit!
 These should not come to Philly -- which is where the Hitch Bot (the peaceful robot that traveled cross-country across Germany, The Netherlands, Canada and 300 miles of the USA) was destroyed within like an hour of arriving, and to the this day they haven't found the head  .  
My local shop is a few hundred yards away and still uses them  .   I don't use them because it's faster for me to walk there than it is to have it delivered  .   Besides, if we all used them we would be as fat as Americans!
Yeah you should see them when they are all parked up in a row, looks like a robot invasion is gonna take place I have seen these used at a CO OP shop in a town just outside Cambridge too  .   Let's hope Skynet doesn't get involved
What a piece of crap, can it carry really large boxes? can it carry heavy boxes? my neighborhood has no sidewalks, so now what  .   Leave the work for the humans to do and stop trying to cut out people, you greedy bastards  .  
it will be a nightmare for anyone living in the financial district or Chinatown, this bots gonna get so confused and the amount if traffic will be difficult for the chaperone to get to the bot and push it and at that point, it's just a cart
they are too bulky on a sidewalk, like pushing bulk wheel kids ride carts or jumbo baby carriages  .  , they will need a main vehicle that deploys them in a center or average range  .   Which is why fly drones, even bigger, are getting popular  .  
Return and waste food, or donate it they have an option I'm sure, you can also probably pull off some one time fraud using a prepaid debit card but your paying before it even is sent out so them canceling the order could be non refundable once its placed  .  
there are a fair number of people who are starting to say "I don't even have to leave my house"  .   Just saying that we are probably gonna turn into the humans on the spaceship from WALL-E if we accept that attitude for all of our activities  .  
Yeah  .   those will be getting mugged and vandalized all over the place  .   Throw a blanket over it and the sensors are done  .   Driving those through Chicago street with food and the homeless will be doing whatever it takes to get into those  .   Good luck with all that  .  
Conceptually we all have visions of what the future could look like but as a few people have commented already, space on sidewalks, vandalism, tampering, & theft, even with flying drones, are a huge reality that would likely see these fail after the novelty wore off  .   
when you don't have a job , we are not gonna give you any money to buy a home or order food with a stupid robot  .   So, when you realize that you are gonna starve immediately, what are you gonna do about it?
The only danger is the robots being stolen with their groceries never arrive to it's destination nor come home in big cities, that a reality that can't be mess with  .   Keep it where they r  .   try it in LA, you will know what to expect right?
where are people gonna get jobs? I would be happy to kick over every kiwi bot I see  .   I hope your innovation involves the ability to Right itself after getting kicked over  .   And a magical food container that doesn't spill everything when I kick the bot over  .  
But people know if they break, steal or damage a $2000 robot, Door dash will definitely report it to the cops  .   But if someone just takes the food without damaging the robot, it won't be worth door dash/the cops' time to try to find someone who stole $20 worth of food  .  
In the time it takes the robot to travel one city block, a delivery person on a bike will have gone more than 10 blocks  .   Also, the robot can't negotiate a series of steps, and many other obstacles  .   This fad will go the way of pet rocks  .  
Not interested I would rather have a people being that i's created in the image of God that needs to pay their bills and feed their family stop putting humans aside because you want to put more money in your pocket you wicked greedy CEOs turn from your evil ways to Jesus Christ
This is not reality because the robot in these days we live would get stolen lets be for real, if we lived in a world where no one steals that would be great but as you know we don't live in that world so this idea is not good at all  .  
no one is looking or thinking about the bigger picture  .   Is absolutely ridiculous and it’s not just about these and delivery drivers  .   It’s everything no matter what career path you choose a robot eventually will take over  .   They will make the rich richer and the poor poorer
everybody talks about thieves, but they forget there is an easy upgrade to solve it: weapons  .   Install a machine gun or a bomb for when it's being broken into  .   Or like a bomb in Black Mirror dispersing fragments that penetrate the people flesh and emit a location signal  .  
So that must have a form of camera or cameras, where is that data going and is it being stored for any amount of time and how do you request it? Seems like GDPR is not being followed as it didn't Identify itself and let you know it was recording lol
They have cameras installed all the way around the middle of them, they’re quite annoying to be honest as they are constantly getting in peoples way on foot paths And quite often they stop outside my house blocking my car in on the drive when they get stuck on the kerb
Securing the food and allowing access to the customer shouldn't be their main concern  .   Having a person stealing the robot entirely, someone trying to open it, wreck it for fun, hit by a car, navigation glitching, are just one of the issues that comes to mind   .  
Just more production of plastic waste at 4 mph it's like sending your granny for YOUR FISH & CHIPS ANY ONE OUT OF DIVILMENT COULD THROW ANY THING ON YOUR FOOD OR JUST TAKE IT ?? IT WILL BE JUST LIKE THE SINCE AIR 3 WHEELER I WOULD NOT ORDER FROM IT FAT PEOPLE MIGHT
This is not gonna catch on  a major level  .   Locally and within campuses and buildings with food spots, sure  .   But that's about it  .   It's too slow and I GUARANTEE your these will get stolen  .   Imagine this thing going past homeless or drunk people who are hungry
Too many drivers cherry picking orders & claiming they’ll mess with orders, I’d rather more apps start using these even if it takes away some gigs  .   These aren’t jobs, they’re side income gigs, so hopefully more apps will start to look into this  .  
Millenials, enjoy your unemployed future! Allowing these robots on the sidewalk and streets is the corporate privatization of a public space  .   A private road just for Starship  .   Why not have a fleet of them in public parks, like mobile vending machines? Oh wait, that's the plan  .  
When this happens with self driving cars (without a driver) the passengers will be stuck, unable to take over driving  .   They will be like sitting ducks, vulnerable  .   Probably will be a persistent problem because they will never be able to program these things to run people over intentionally, defensively  .  
HATE THEM, It taking jobs  .   They lie about that  .   Protest them, Do not Order from them  .   You might think it not my job i don't care  .   Until It your job and you do care  .   TRASH  .   Money Grabbing Greedy Companies, want robots because they wont complain  .  
I know this sounds like a cunty thing to say, but I would smash it  .   It's just another example of big corps thinking about greed more than jobs  .   It defo won't catch on around here  .   Well, it might catch on fire, but that's about it  .  
All the delivery robots here in LA have been stolen  .   They first had gang graffiti all over them, then thugs would put trash and even dead animals in them, most deliveries would get stolen, then two were found dumped in Echo Park lake  .   "You can't have nice things "
I worked as a Postmates Live Order Support Representative and 5 months ago I received a call  .   It's a complaint call from someone saying that she fear for her life when she encountered one of these thing on the street of California, she said these little fucker chase her ass off  .  
They do have a tendency to stop and think while in the middle of an intersection and it's never a good thing from what I am told  .   Stories of trucks dragging them underneath and starships going along missing wheels are common here  .   I suppose they carry insurance as the rest of us do
terrifying prospect with capitalism  .   imagine the amount of data their cameras can process and sell  .   privacy is already in a precarious situation: without data protection laws like this will be misused to create a surveillance corpocracy  .   innit great when your health insurance goes up because a delivery bot saw you jaywalking
And I say, what difference does it make if these pots are well made, if the only thing they do by making these inventions is taking work from others and not being able to take money home, when the one who is gonna take it is the mechanic of these pots  .  
This will take away people jobs  .   THINK! Oh by the way  .   I am not a delivery guy  .   I work in IT  .   before you go THINKING I am trying to protect my job  .   Please try to see the bigger picture and the impact on society and people life on earth!
I saw one of these repeatedly bumping a curb one time and i felt sad for it  .   It was the weirdest feeling  .   I think its an extension of the customer  .   Like knowing their food is lost and getting cold somewhere on the side of the road alone while they are wondering what happened  .  
Ha, ha  .   No more jobs for anyone, most of them will go to the robots in the coming years  .   I don't want to work anyway, that's why people need to go to Etsy and buy up my "Impact" and "Dance of Death" James Grider novels  .  
Just like the fat blobs on the spaceship from wall e  .   Yea it's amazing I sit in the house all day working on my computer, and then when I finally get the chance to walk to the shop I don't, I just sit on my backside and let the drone do it!
Wow! Soon there will be no use for humans  .   no jobs for people  .   no money  .   just robots  .   Yet this is seen as progress in technology more like ending the people race  .   These are advertised proudly in reality you should be ashamed of yourselves and anyone using them should be also!
What about old fashioned currier services? Sad that this these machines are taking the place of employing real people who are desperately seeking employment,  .   Love to see a missed avoidance of a collision  .   What happens when someone trips over it?  .   Those stupid robots in grocery stores are slow and annoying  .  
Yeah I mean even as a ten year old's we would be setting up traps to heist the chocolate biscuits and see if they had lager in there  .   Never underestimate how cunning a ten year old can be   .   And those druggies would have it empty and burning within minutes of it leaving the store   .  
Why wouldn't they opt for an aerial version? It would have certainly been faster  .   That thing moves at a snail's pace, it would take forever to get your parcel assuming they just let it run loose from the post office  .   Also, to be honest it looks rather easy to steal from  .  
Knowing what sort of people exist, I don't think things like these will be able to exist  .   As soon as I saw this robot and what it is supposed to do, my first reaction was - vandalism, theft, etc.  .   Until people's behavior changes, such things won't last long  .  
Unfortunately everyone is being brainwashed  .   Don’t be fooled that these robots are cute  .   They’re designed to draw your emotions toward them so that you will accept them  .   Wait until they are Weaponized and police everything that you do  .   Only then you will regret ever stepping foot into this realm  .  
Do not see the point in this as in general they would be attacked, goods stolen, children riding on them  .   These things, and drones will not survive in the real world  .   This is a one off, and only a small amount of goods delivered, not making it worth the trouble  .  
I am so glad you stalked a bot! I have wanted to do this  .   I am in the countryside so they would probably get stuck down county lanes never seen one in the wild myself  .   Scary really, I am a Sainsbury's driver myself and this thing is gonna take my job!
It looks ridiculous  .   Why would you build this  .   Either it's gonna be stolen, kids will break it or it just won't work, as it won't be able to get certain places  .   Glad to know my amazon are gonna a good cause, who needs properly paid workers?
If a people operator has to go along side it "just in case", then why not just have that people drive the thing or - deliver the food himself? Having a robot do the delivery offers no advantages unless it is fully autonomous  .   We are close, but not quite there yet  .   JW3HH
Public robots will contain CCTV, facial recognition, and various tamper deterrents  .   The question is, who will own this data? I would expect to see future legislation requiring public robot operators to integrate with law enforcement to extend surveillance network coverage  .   Should lead to a reduction in crime and provide a net benefit  .  
I still don't think mechanically they are advanced for the market  .   Things such in the real world as pushing it over, knocking it down will happen and those things cant get up themselves  .   Stealing also for an example as someone can break those things open since mass production of those things require cheap materials usually  .  
How do all of these unemployed people afford take-out? People who are incapable of making their own food and are to frightened or lazy to go out  .   Well at least they found a way to eliminate the jobs of the little guy, in order to increase corporate CEO's bonuses  .   Now that is technology!
That's just a novelty   .   the domino and Ford self-driving cars delivering pizza are on point; they are gonna be just as quick as a driver  .   Well, maybe slightly slower if it were moped  .   but it's only a matter of time till self-driving mopeds come along  .   or drones  .  
Well, I guess in a few years even the truck deploying these delivery system will lack a people being either driving or delivering the package  .    .  I was wondering if everyone's gonna get a universal basic income since the jobs available will be very few and only for extremely intelligent people  .    .  humans are absolutely fuck****
I am just gonna take the robot  .   Of course I would simply look at the patent plans which are available publicly to understand how the robot works  .   Thus, understanding how to shut it down and remove it from the grid  .   Now I have an expensive robot, and I have some free food  .  
eheh yes, it is cute  .   I doubt it will be hit by a car, given it is very conservative when deciding to cross the street  .   However it is a possibility  .   Mean people are actually a real concern: I have seen upset people banging on them or kicking them  .   no idea why!
Good, but it needs the ability to use elevators, and additionally, it seems rather slow, to the extent that it appeared to be blocking people's access along the pavement  .   Speed it up by 50-75% and deal with the elevator problem and you are onto a winner, otherwise, I am not too sure  .  
Hmm this robot is gonna stuck For an example: karen wants to buy amazon with bots but she orders a lot and when she is done ordering the bot came but some how stuck karen asked “where are my food??? I’ve paid for like a 1000 bucks you’ve just wasted my
Always choose a person over a robot or they will enslave us one day  .   Make these horrible electric boxes extinct  .   People won't think they are cool once they tamale over? Will they? Also end electric cars too  .   We need exhaust fumes because it's better than clean air even if you cough occasionally  .  
Honestly it’s slow as hell and took 1h and 20 minutes to deliver a 5 minute walk order and it also went to the long way around even though there was a good enough path for it to go past but it had to go another way which was annoying  .   I prefer a people at least it’s faster!
They won't pay us more than $2-5 for a delivery or TWO, but they invest MILLIONS into this little shit thinking they can be even MORE CHEAP by scrimping and saving the measly base salaries they pay people!!?! ABSOLUTELY STUPID  .   Idk if Dara could possibly get any more stupid  .   Smh  .   Good luck idiots
This is a good idea, but it assumes the best of people nature  .   Expect a lot of people to put masks and hoods up to evade any cameras it has, and to steal or vandalize the units regularly  .   Good idea, as I say, but this is an asshole magnet if I ever saw one  .  
all those alarms, cameras wouldn't do much to save the robots, that's if the police can find the perpetrator and if caught, especially the way the law is nowadays, giving more rights to the criminal, victims not having any rights, the criminals will be out in no time to continue being a menace  .  
How much have companies, who use public infrastructure to pay the municipality? I don´t like the thought that Amazon and others use the sidewalk, which I paid for, for their business concept and when I jog, I always have to run around their drones  .   The sidewalk is for humans, not for some companies products  .  
No brake lights or indicator and no stop warning and also can block pavements when two come together I believe that need more work and not good when mobility scooter are behind and they stop too fast with no warning when it is moving forward and nothing blocking the way don't go as it stops like it's been blocked when not
How disgusting! The height of laziness! And meanwhile, everybody else is supposed to get out of the way for a machine  .   And btw, isn't this motorized machine supposed to get a license plate, for operating in public  .   And isn't it against the law to have machines, or have bicycles on the sidewalks?
No brake lights or indicator and no stop warning and also can block pavements when two come together I believe that need more work and not good when mobility scooter are behind and they stop too fast with no warning when it is moving forward and nothing blocking the way don't go as it stops like it's been blocked when not
Great technology but what about edge cases? Houses that aren’t in urban areas without footpaths for example? What about if the local scallies see these and top them up/throw them in the river? I am sure we’ll see a lot more of this in the future - maybe drones would keep them safe from the aforementioned scallies
Tried to use this service today for the first time  .   Approx 1 hr delivery stated by app  .   Paid by card  .   Nearly 3 hrs later stone cold food delivered by a man in a van  .   Told to reorder and pay again!! Refund not showing on my bank account  .   Absolutely terrible service  .   WILL NEVER USE AGAIN  .   BEWARE!
Not sure about this, not sure if this will provide us with a good future  .  Wake up, we are replacing ourselves  .   How can this be sustainable for humans if we can no longer work? how will we pay our bills? This is very worrying! I hope this is only things of the movies and not in reality  .  
These things in theory are good but that's where the good ends , we have a huge part of the population walking around in these locations and the bots just end up creating more traffic hazards and confusion in said locations  .   They may work well inside company buildings or schools but we are already way to lazy & out of shape   .    .  
I am only 30 seconds into the video and the only thing I can think of is "I want to poke that thing with a stick"  .   Turn it upside down and see what it does  .   If you get in it's way for too long does it get all ED209 on you? - "You Have 20 Seconds To Comply"
This is actually a stupid idea, a very stupid idea  .   how many of these stuffs are gonna be on the walk lane with humans? or is the government gonna build special walk ways for the robot? Innovate other areas or think more on how to reduce delivery time! this one is a very dumb & stupid idea
Here's a design challenge I don't think they have addressed: That thing is a perfect, moving, white canvas for graffiti  .   I can imagine it instantly being tagged by someone with a can of spray paint  .   Can you imaging your artisinal cupcake being delivered by a robot plastered with "FAT YUPPIES GO HOME!"?
Not sure if they could, but there should be a way for a person to communicate with the robot's people dispatch, controller  .   There will be needs to change driving routes etc  .   So yeah, even needs for Police to inspect the contents  .   I can totally see crime networks using these bots to deliver their "goods"  .  
There are hundreds of thousands of jobs open for people with 30 IQ points above average, yet we aren't breeding or importing these people above the rate of death  .   The jobs average people can do already don't pay enough to support a family without subsidies and those jobs are being eliminated at a fast pace  .   What is the answer?
Well i don't think this will be deployed on ghetto areas  .   It has a lock on it and a camera so whoever orders it and there is drugs there will be easy to track down who did it  .   This is only for campus in the future they will have cars that's deliverer food in cities, this id for collage campus
this robot is meant to take very short-distance orders that normal dashers wouldn’t take because it’s too small a payout  .   things that are like five miles or more a robot just wouldn’t be able to do as quickly or efficiently as a people in a car would  .  
How much are you paid to copy and paste that BS? Hey, How are people with disabilities and diminished capacity gonna get there food if there is not a person there to hand it to them with the care only a people can provide? Your RC cars will fail and I will be very hostile toward these machines if I see them  .  
Or kidnapped by tweakers for their copper wiring   .  lol I could see it now  .    .   BREAKING NEWS!!!!!!! Modesto robot kidnapped, then murdered, police say the victim was tortured with screw drivers and bolt cutters before it succumbed to its injuries  .   A meth pipe was found at the scene, along with random vacuum cleaner parts  .  
Its just some marketing gimmick  .   In reality, these robots have the luxury of being confined to the sidewalk, so they can pretend to have "level 4 autonomy" This might work in big cities and certain suburbs, but I really don't see it working all that well outside of those environments  .  
This technology will burn itself out - once they catch on there will be too many of them for the pavement and the novelty will ware off  .   There will be campaign groups to ban them, as they will be seen as a danger to pedestrians  .   Then they will then be banished to the road where they will cause congestion and a danger to road users  .

What if after the customer order and the robot went to pick up the food but then later the customer cancelled the order while the robot is delivering  .   Does the robot return the food to the restaurant or do they just kept on going? Cause with Postmates customer could still cancelled order even after pickup which is why most driver end up with free food  .  
Cute but it's really the end of our world as we know it  .   This technology is gonna cause so many jobs to be lost that society itself is gonna break down  .   Autonomous automation is most likely after your job and if it's not, it's after the job of people that will be able to pay you to do yours  .  
This toaster with wheels isn't gonna replace a food delivery driver lmao  .   It can get cracked open like a pinata by literally anyone who sees it rolling down the sidewalk  .   Not to mention, it moves slower than a kid on a scooter  .   My fruit will be ruined and my ice cream would have melted by the time it gets to my door

This will create INSANE social divisions, victim blaming and racism! There are neighborhoods where these things will be instantaneously attacked, looted, dismantled and vandalized  .   Yes these are racially apartheid ghettoes, especially in the US  .   The resentful poor will implicitly drive these things from where they live and these communities will be catastrophically left outside of the benefits of this progress  .

It would take all day to deliver one package  .   Anyone could see it crawling slowly down the sidewalk  .   Can it deliver up three flights of stairs safely? Can it drive 100 miles per day to deliver to customer's home? What if the wrong package was placed within the Scout? What if the customer isn't home? This thing is a joke  .

A lot of accidents using those robots  .   It could collide with motor vehicles, run over dog or cat crap and they would be bringing the dung and smell to your doorstep, etc.  .   I do like the concept, though  .   I would prefer a drone drop  .   Drones high enough and can detect presence, so it doesn't land on anyone's head  .  
One thing people are overlooking imo is physical security imo, especially if a company is gonna use smaller delivery robots - I can see a lot of people picking them up and trying to smash them to get to whatever is inside  .   Same for delivery vans - people will just stand in front of them and then use another group to smash them to get the goods  .  
I expect that they shall be destructed and their content stolen  .   Additionally, this is inefficient for anywhere that provides delivery of many meals simultaneously, such as cities  .   Its sole niche shall be autonomous delivery of food within rural provinces, but I do not expect that it shall be adopted within those regions  .   Ultimately, I expect that it is doomed for failure  .  
The future is here, didn't look like it had a large volume for carrying stuff mind  .   With people losing their jobs to robots, we are gonna need to find a way to pay all of these out of work people so they can survive  .   Perhaps we can tax the robot owners enough to pay us all to enjoy a life of leisure  .  
World's massively overpopulated and growing  .   Greedy corporations bringing robots to take people rolls/take our jobs  .   Humans beginning to feel the strain of this though cover stories  .   Soon to feel the noose tighten more around our necks this winter  .   Yes help this robot take a persons job  .   Help it  .   It needs to work to feed it's master's greed  .   Fuck humanity
I am sad that this will replace Humans  .   Robots are being deployed daily in various ways all in effort to make things more efficient, but at the same time replacing humans  .   The fewer employed Humans there are the fewer consumers you have  .   If I am not employed I am not buying your products  .   Simple let’s not allow Robots to take over  .  
Yep  .   One job to program 50,000 deliveries opposed to 50,000 people deliveries  .   The employment stats don't add up  .   I love technology but there is a tipping point where cheap machines do all the work leaving very little for humans to do except sit on our arsis and claim unemployment benefits  .   That's not much of an economy  .   There needs to be a sensible line somewhere  .  
These robots are a public nuisance they are very intimidating for the elderly and dog walkers  .   They do not stop when you approach often forcing pedestrians into the road  .   I hope they are short lived and lazy people make the effort to collect their own food orders  .   The elderly and disabled are mostly not tech savvy and wouldn't use these anyway  .   Zero benefit maximum nuisance  .  
Exactly what I was thinking  .   My daughter works 3 jobs saving up to get a place of her own with her fiance he works full-time 7 days a week and they would still struggle  .   One of her jobs is door dashing now that's in jeopardy  .   I am not condoning the recent crime rate but I am starting to understand why when you can't even support yourself with 3 incomes
Well one of the major questions, is simply how do these systems really work effectively given for months on end we have all been hearing about the flash mobs or even individuals, going into stores and just randomly looting the place, In other words how are these boxes rolling down the road and no one smashing the bastard with the sledgehammer and taking the contents inside??
I agree the stealing is a tougher ask, but vandalism would be easy  .   Problem with cameras, is some asshole can just shove a hood and mask on and push it or kick it over, again after covering their face  .   Also, how heavy are they? I could easily imagine a group of drunken louts throwing something like this over a bridge into a river  .  
it's hard not to be cynical about the practicality of this sort of thing  .   Without a major shift in people's attitudes in society  .   If you really think these things will be able to trundle through graffiti-strewn inner cities delivering people's pizzas at 1 am in the morning on a Saturday night untouched and left alone, then your belief in people nature is way better than mine  .  
Imagine ordering door dash and getting a text saying your robot got stuck in a pile of shit 4  .  2 miles away and you have to go rescue your food or you’ll be hungry and out of a refund  .   then you remember the only reason you ordered door dash in the first place is because your on house arrest and can’t go further then your front porch  .  
I think automated delivery drones is a better idea  .   They would take cars off the road but not take up space on the sidewalks for humans and would be out of reach of thieves and vandals which seem to be two of the biggest complaints and concerns in the comment section and also could travel much faster than this sidewalk robot thus leading to fewer cold burritos and pizzas  .  
Whilst I can see these being good if you are unable (for instance because of health/mobility issues), to get to shops and need something quickly, the reality is that this is an expensive way to get your groceries  .   The local shops that use these are expensive anyway and then the prices are more expensive on the App, and on top of that, you pay £1  .  49- £1  .  99 for delivery  .  
I am wearing a mask, by the time the Police deem to turn up I will be long gone with me free Cuppa-soups and Fray Bentos steak pies  .   What next a Police car escorting every robot (sort of 'Robocop' in reverse) - actually just get the cops to deliver the groceries (they are not much use for anything else) and save the cost of the robot - I am a Fking moneysaving genius!
Amazon with the delivery drones, Uber with the driverless car, Door dash with this robot, don't you find funny how all these companies that made millions/billions using people without many "regular job" benefits are now trying to get rid of them? i think something is broken here and someone has to do something or we will have the worst crisis of the world in history in some years
Totally inadequate design for most cities in America  .   Too light and small and those wheels would get hung up on every little pebble or slightest bump  .   These robots would become crime and vandalism magnets once their novelty wears off in most US cities regardless of the security features built into them  .   They need to be at least the size of a shopping cart or home freezer chest on a 6x6 wheel chassis  .  
I think it is difficult to monitor it and ensure it is safe  .   If some one break it or steal it, how you do? There are many leased vehicle or bicycles, electric car or bikes on street for rent  .   But no control on it  .   Many bicycles or bikes are broken and throw away any place inside river, on street, under bridge  .   Then they go bankrupt  .  
these won't last long  .   The electronic parts in these baby's make them a very profitable money maker for anyone interested in electronics or selling electronic parts  .   my hometown, Bradford, has some of Britain's worst crime rates, and is the nations most burgled region, with the highest car I sursnce premiums in the whole UK, so I guarantee you, these would be nicked in seconds here  .  
Just use (e)bike delivery  .   I doubt, that these robots can compete with the speed and low price tag of a bike delivery service in the near future, even when using new and "cheap" sensors and Mems-Lidar systems  .   And where is the proof that this vehicle is smarter than the tesla (which I highly doubt, since Tesla's are using a custom dual core MPU specifically designed for that task)?
In my country we drive around in motorcycles to deliver foods for ubereats and other apps  .  I guess this would mean competition, lol  .    .  Maybe not in the States but I am quite sure if they tried using those here in my country the biker delivery guys would start running over them, steal them or somehow disrupting their operation XD   .  that technology would not be welcome here at all I am sure  .  
yes but tracks and wheels can be sometimes damaged  .  the real issues was the wheels they installed were way too thin  .  real wheels was thick enough for the job, looks like research is needed to withstand any environmental risk of getting stuck, it's hard for sensors to see objects and it’s hard for robots like the ones in the video to get through things (or they just doesn’t change location which is worse and annoying)
This tech trips me out  .   Walmart* drones , food delivery via remote control cars ECT  .     .   Wind up watches were the most popular thing once upon a time   .   Now we’re flooded with input and confused on what to engage with  .   Usually people make good decisions but there are many who don’t   .   Those are the ones who made others create “rules”  .   Ok too much for a cooler on wheels clip   .  
Lol FedEx can't even compete with Amazon on delivery efficiency as it is  .   Just watch, this thing is gonna be the source of so many lawsuits for FedEx as it damages peoples property and runs over puppy dogs  .   The only way you could be panicked by these things is if you put too much faith in this technology  .   The threat to your job is still tied to how easy it is to replace with a kiosk  .  
The main problem of these robots is speed  .   My university has smaller versions of these delivery bots called Starships, which can each carry a max of 40 lbs  .   Impressive, since it can navigate around people, but they are SUPER slow - they crawl around at 3 mph and wait for 5 minutes at each crossing and streetlight  .   That will be the main issue with these to become feasible - to be faster and be able to move when traffic moves too  .  
Plain stupid, will never work in real world  .   It will be stolen right away, broken into pieces, and sold  .   What is the cost of each unit? How much carbon emission does it takes to build one compared to something much more simple like  .   better food packaging's? How much autonomy does it have? Challenging the status quo is not getting money from investors with a nice corporate video, you need some actual information  .  
totally agree with you, theft isn't the issue it's straight up vandalism  .   I can just imagine this happening with a bunch of drunk prats or Chavs in balaclavas breaking it  .   The damage is done, not only the order is not delivered but the Take-away or restaurant has lost a lot of money from losing the robot and the potential loss of customer retention  .   I can imagine the insurance on one of these badboys is astronomical!!
They are actually starting to do this in big cities now  .   UberEats is experimenting with these delivery robots in a few big cities like Los angels, at this current moment  .   As a pedestrian in a big city (not LA), I have almost gotten ran over so many times  .   So, I wonder what happens if someone runs over this robot? If they can't see me, how are they gonna see a small robot? JW
OK but, what about motorbikes? Or even better, electric bikes? They are way faster, and they don't take up valuable space on sidewalks which is already limited in most places  .   Then there is also the issue of how defenseless these bots are  .   Robots are nice and all but we can't solve every problem by throwing swarms of robots/drones at them  .   Especially ones that have already been solved, or easy to solve with existing solutions  .  
I believe the monetization potential for these is low because R&D costs are high  .   If you charge the same delivery fee as a people driver and pass the profit to the robot owning company, that company will turnover a little less than 30k a year per robot (because robots are slower, limited in range, etc.)  .   That's very slow profits  .   And it can't be expanded multiplicatively as there are only so many deliveries within range of these robots  .  
You Know what much better than robot and good for environment   .  CYCLISTS THAT DELIVER FOOD   .    .   You do understand right that you can still sit at home order food and have real Person who needs money and enjoys the job and satisfaction supporting local business and people   .  SO MUCH MORE MEANING Don't order from Emotionless Meaningless Robot   .    .  Your cutting out the middle person   .  for no benefit to you   .  you will still pay delivery charge   .  instead now it all goes to company   .    .  
It's never gonna work, guys  .   Can you imagine 100 of those on your streets? But 1000? Or 10k? Sidewalks not wide enough for pedestrians  .   And those robots gonna be there  .   Some of them gonna stay in the middle of sidewalk when they discharged or just malfunctioned  .   There are suppose to be separate roads for them  .   And even maybe highway railways  .   Only last 15-50 meters they could make on wheels  .   Other time those robots suppose to ride separate roads  .  
I came across one of these, all scruffy and only three wheels in a shop doorway and as I passed it said "got any change guv" I haven't had a charge for ages and I am really low on battery and because I am disabled I can't work  .   They have stopped my benefits and I am reduced to sleeping rough  .   I knew these humans would take over and leave me unemployed  .   But They say you can't stop the wheels of progress  .  
So when these robots take the jobs from the black people that are grudgingly delivering cold greasy food to woke white people, I guarantee the temperature in the room is gonna go up  .   Next thing you know, out come the hammers and crowbars ( smash & grabs), ghost guns, ( follow home invasions) and stimulus scams  .   It’s already rampant in Los Angeles  .   To tell you the truth, I can’t blame them  .   Enjoy your robots for now you bug people  .  
Well the first thing I noticed, it has far more manners than a deliveroo rider, those f*+kers just barge past us on their bikes , starship was very well mannered and respectful of the roads! Mind you, at those speeds I am guessing if we ordered some takeaway grub via starship it might turn up a tad cold! Yeah , if those things were in Manchester they would end up either upside down on a bus stop roof or arise up in the canal!
I deliver for Walmart (Spark program) and while I think robots could assist us with transferring items from our vehicles to the door (we load onto unit), delivering on their own is risky just based on that video you showed  .   I have a wagon cart in my car which makes transporting cases of water and other heavy items easier, so a robot unit could be useful for that but yeah if it can't climb stairs or a few steps then I will just stick with the ol' wago-cart  .  
You are not allowed to ride an electric scooter but you are allowed to have these share the same space, most footpaths are barely wide enough for two people to pass let alone a pram and one of these, cannot make the stores out they moan about the amount of footfall coming through their shops then encourage you to stay away from them???, Won't be too long before there will be any use for a people being on this planet, the whole world has gone mad  .  
What a bunch of fools the most amazing thing that has ever been created is the people body and we are trying to surpass that by making a box with wheels that goes slower than a people doesn't think things through only does what it's told by a people all I see is laziness here not innovation  .   See this is what happens when you tell every little kid that they are great you are gonna have to weed out the idiots so as to keep this stupidity from reaching the stupid  .  
doubt it, it looks like its avoiding obstacles by sensing on top and maximizing the unobstructed distance ahead  .   The problem is that it detects "no tree" at the height of the sensors but it does not detect the tree root near the wheels  .   It may be still in a state of "no obstacles" but it doesn't know that its not changing location  .   A people remote controlling it would obviously understand its stuck and try to point it elsewhere but robots are sometimes too dumb to act adaptively :))
This will never come to a city like LA or NY  .   The rep is a SJW type (believes an alarm or intervention will deter theft)  .   I live in LA and this will never be  .   Trust  .   An alarm will not support safety for this robot  .   You need to attach a shock device or ability to shoot anyone that touches it (crazy but true)  .   I would only support /invest in drone delivery  .   SJW's need to live in a real world, not the imaginary digital one that most techtards live  .  
I can see people stealing those and chopping them up to either reuse the parts or to part the robot out on eBay  .   Some company will lose thousands of dollars by purchasing those and having them stolen  .   Artificial Intelligence is no match for real intelligence wanting to seal something, or some halfwit just wanting to hit it with a car  .   The city has chains on their garbage cans  .   That should tell you something about people nature  .   Oh  .  they have gps trackers?, expect those to be sold as well  .  
The WALL-E looking robot is only partially suitable for street use  .   It must be able to right itself when it hits a curb poorly and falls over  .   Vandalism  .   Theft  .   Keeping food hot or cold  .   Street-traveling robot design has a long way to go yet  .   What if it meets a kid on a bicycle? Did we see pneumatic tires? I hope not  .   I don't think we want to deal with tires going flat  .   At least the journey to find a suitable design in underway  .   Forward, ever  .   :)
Finally! Time to displace hundreds of thousands of workers- starts with the gig economy then everything else  .   Better get ready to reskill or be phased out everyone! Get ready for the inevitable widening of inequality and subsequent social unrest  .   And i don't think universal basic income is the answer with potential problems like inflation if people's buying power increases, market saturation in the remaining professions and a lack of or failures in a global and coordinated tax system due to regulatory/ tax arbitrage resulting from political/ geopolitical disputes, competition and corporate greed  .  
We don't have much space on the sidewalks, now I will have to share this space with a swarm of robots delivering food for people in offices or homes, which doesn't seem appealing to me  .   The guy said something about cities for people, but his project looks kind of the opposite because you are taking the space from the people, we already have too many cars in the streets, and now he wants to sell us cars for the sidewalks, I don't think this is scalable, at least not in the sidewalks
I am not sure that it's legal for this thing to be on the sidewalk, also when it crosses the streets it needs to have headlights, signals, brake lights a horn, etc.  .   Also, how would it perform in snowy, icy weather  .   In suburban America after a snowstorm no one is shoveling their sidewalks for weeks from December to March  .   And the snowplows pile up snow on the curb, side of the road  .   I have to shovel out my mailbox on the curb so that the mailman can get access to the box  .  
That thing is a huge waste of money  .   people will not only steal it's packages, but steal the whole damn $20,000 robot and sell it for $10 worth of steel and copper  .   The future of delivery is having your packages held at a convenient safe place like the UPS store  .   Protected from porch pirates while you are at work, and you can swing by and pick it up on your way home  .   Any time I have a valuable package coming from UPS or FedEx I always have it delivered to the store if I am not gonna be home on delivery day  .  
This is an easy treasure box: throw a thin blanket over it, two guys lift it quickly into the back of a van, pry it open with hands (lids look so flimsy) or pry bar, take out the prize, dump out of the van anywhere after smearing cams, drive off with the goods  .   RINSE AND REPEAT  .   These will never get traction in a lawless society  .   I also see people destroying them constantly by kicking, putting obstacles down, shooting out tires or slashing tires, throwing mud and oil, etc.  .   No  .   these will not last long in certain areas  .  
Superb! BUT a few questions  .   How does it cross roads safely, avoiding a moving car - does it use zebra crossings - and how? Also, I suspect the lids lock until arrival at the address but if not couldn't someone open it and run off with a free meal? And what's to prevent the numerous idiots in society picking it up and bunging it in a river? Now I know they work and its brilliant, but if they were only at the stage of talking about using them then I for one wouldn't believe they were viable -BUT THEY ARE!!! Thanks  .  
What is SO "Cool" about Robots putting Humans out of work ??? A few years ago, I had Safeway regularly deliver groceries to my home by a people Driver  .   What will happen to all those people Drivers ??? Does Anyone Even Care ??? Only a Sucker would believe that Robots replacing Humans is "Progress" and Mass Media Propaganda is trying hard to make you that Sucker !!! There is NO Way that I would allow a Robot to deliver groceries to my door !!! I would rather Starve than to Surrender Humanity to a Machine !!!
Of course, this program is very absurd because the machine is the first thing that is small and slow  .   Even if I was the thinker, I would say at least Make the project in the form of a Taron, flying and landing on the place of requests, which is the intended location, even though this idea also failed  .   Because the atmosphere is not for these Trones, and accidents collide in the air is a possibility of the highest degree  .   And if we say the idea of ​​drone in the sky, then we must establish an air traffic control station for robots  .   This idea is really ridiculous
I live in Seattle  .   For the past 10 years we have been dealing with an increase in homelessness, created by the cost of living, the lack of mental health/social services support, and government inaction  .   One side effect of this has been the increase in crime and vandalism in the downtown core  .   Scooter and bike rentals have suffered from theft and repurposed assets by the "unhoused", and I would anticipate these robots would be even more vulnerable to predation given the easy access to goods being delivered  .   I wish this were not the case, as this is a legitimate way to reduce traffic and automate mundane work  .  
So this is why kids are fat in inactive because they can't get up off their asses to go get their own food sure they may be sitting down studying real hard and they can't afford the time to get up and go sustain their selves then they probably shouldn't be eating this thing is gonna get stolen it's gonna get smashed people aren't gonna get their food right it's a bunch of b******* and you are taking away people's jobs I say screw it get rid of it we don't need stuff like this when people get lazy they start to die same with a society  .  
Fascinating  .   I wonder if they might later modify it to find you, so if you  went into a bookstore (I think those still exist!), it would "track" your phone there, and wait outside like a puppy  .   The "wait for no traffic" seems sketchy given its low speed  .   Crossing vehicle roads at far less than vehicle speeds is adventurous (remember Frogger)  .   No doubt everyone near San Diego has seen those yellow signs on the freeway that are not deer impact warnings but "illegal border crosser" warnings  .   I have always wondered but I assume they are there because crossing lanes of fast traffic holds unintended consequences  .  
These are interesting sure, but I don’t see how they’re gonna solve the US’ problem of car-oriented design  .   Places that are designed for cars aren’t gonna become urban paradises because of delivery robots (Not to mention where would these robots even go on suburban or rural roads without sidewalks? Could they even travel the distances necessary to make deliveries in car-oriented neighborhoods?)  .   Chances are these would be used in already urban neighborhoods with shorter delivery distances and existing sidewalks  .   But then, these neighborhoods are already at least somewhat walkable by definition  .   Adding delivery robots doesn’t add more pedestrian space or make a neighborhood more walkable  .  
I did Door dash for a bit, I would drive at least 20+ miles each hour  .   These robots are going a fraction of the speed, meaning any long deliveries would arrive in like an hour and the food would be cold  .   But cold food isn't the main issue  .   If you want to remove 100,000 delivery vehicles, whose delivery efficiency is greater by many orders of magnitude, you will need many hundreds of thousands of delivery robots  .   That is a lot of resources going towards something you are trying to greenwash as being "sustainable"  .   Most delivery drivers use their cars for many different purposes besides just delivering, unlike a 1-purpose delivery robot  .   And how is a human-controlled backup system more advanced than Tesla's AI?
I COULD JUST SEE ONE OF MY FRIENDS IN A WHEECHAIR SITTING AROUND SOME TABLE NOW CHATTING ABOUT THE ROBOT ON THE NARROW SIDEWALK THAT WAS IN THE WAY AS THEY PUSHED THEIR WHEELCHAIR ALL THE WAY UP SOME STREET, AND SO THEY DECIDED TO THROW THE FUCKING THING INTO THE STREET AND GO ON AS CARS SWERVE AND HIT IT DESTROYING IT AND SHIT, LIKE THAT ONE TIME SOMEONE PUSHED A SHOPPING CART TOO HARD AND IT JUST KEPT GOING AND THEN A CAR HIT IT  .   YAY THE LADY N THE POWERCHAIR GETS BLOCKED ON SOME NARROW SIDEWALK WITH A ROBOT WITH THE SAME KIND OF PARTS  .   HOWEVER NOBODY SEEMS TO THINK ABOUT THAT NOW  .   OH JUST WAIT I WILL TIP THAT SHIT OVER BETWEEN SOME PARKED CARS IF I CAN  .  
how many people are gonna try not to steal these what I am wondering I mean California obviously would be the worst place to put this because all those electric bikes they had if you notice they are all gone they have been completely destroyed so how many of these are gonna get destroyed and stolen  .   Honestly I think this is a stupid idea personally I really do I don't think it's gonna do any good at all it's like a drone sometimes the best delivery is a people being it's like man versus the machine  .   And we know that's coming but yeah but I don't see this working because how is this thing gonna survive snow or rain or wind I mean we get snow here in Pennsylvania
I push that stupid robot with the car instead to stop so that could cross! If people are up to help others, let them go for other people doing that instead of shit robots! All life serving sick in the heads up to only their own business and in need to serve now the shit robots they created! Not gonna do that even if they put an end of my life! That actually some do! Just putting ends of people's lives! Making so much money as using other people, creating shit stuff like those robots and cause all others to have miserable, animal's lives! Let them get in hell! No normal people need someone to use them and abuse them! That actually do all brainless or so of the people!
I am betting that al of those now out of work delivery people would strongly disagree   .  If by "Safe" you mean from the ephemeral disease that kills every year since time began ? I suggest a full bubble suit for the rest of your natural born days for you  .  It's the only thing that will truly isolate you  .  from spreading your foolish ideas around to infect the rest of those surrounding you  .  Not me of course  .  I am largely immune from that idiocy  .  Have a great day  .   edit: Just had to add  .  I have my stuff delivered  .  Each and every time a delivery driver arrives I offer them the option to take off that silly muzzle  .  Not once  .  has anyone ever refused and they always thank me  .  amazing right ??
FedEx was the only one whose speed came close to delivering ice cream (or pizza)  .   It handled terrain the best  .   If a delivery boy traveled the speed those bots traveled, he would be fired  .   Any distance longer than 300 to 500 feet will be a problem  .   They need to travel with traffic, or ride a mother ship that can  .   Customers can walk to the store faster  .   People want deliveries when the weather and/or traffic is bad  .   That means freezing rain on doors and moving parts, pushing and balancing on snow, many icy roads, sidewalks, and slopes, and extreme cold (batteries), not to mention cracked asphalt, potholes, and broken concrete  .   Pizza delivery people supply their car and gas  .   These expensive robots will require a business to purchase at least one, if not a fleet  .  
I would NEVER EVER  trust eating that food  .   How far did it have to travel? Someone could pick it up and steal it  .   though the camera will show but what if person was HEAD TO TOE COVERED IN CLOTHES  .  entire face  .  gloves  .  booties over the shoes or something does the robot have x-ray vision? Also I barley trust people to make my dam food n deliver it  .   But this thing has now your finger prints  .  scanned you all up and down  .   Probably infected you with something u can not feel that goes into blood stream  .   And plus that takes away more jobs from us  .  and makes Americans even MORE overweight  .   We barley have to move to get food now  .   Just push a button or walk a few feet  .   I can't imagine the world in 40 more years for example
I live in a multi-story building with an outer security door  .   So can these robots come up the stairs, ring my unit, wait for the door to be unlocked, open the door by pulling it outwards, come into the foyer, ring for the elevator, pick the correct floor, and then find my unit and knock on the door? Because  .  that is what I am used to for deliveries  .   I see this a good R&D project to push forward technology, but practically speaking, the chances for this technology to put delivery people out of work  .  is nil  .   Just too many ways for this to fail (theft, kids knocking it over, electro-mechanical fail, and general public safety (e  .  g  .   knocks over old lady) or gets dog poop on wheel and then spreads it around  .   Not to mention weather  .  
There are homeless people who love to chase down and rip open robots filled with great-smelling coffees, philly cheese steaks and ruebens with fries, and then there are homeless people who will gladly step aside, understanding the cute little robots, as in this perky little "news bug" (OMG - so cute!!!!!! Oversized Tears - OT - OMG OT SC!!!!!!!!) article, are a march towards that utopian future where everyone, rich or poor, short or tall, get cheesy poofs and candy canes delivered to them by robots  .   No socialists or Antifa betas have been hurt while I write this commentary, but these robots will take away the pizza delivery and coffee-making jobs they get after getting a Masters in Sociology or Social Justice  .   Who would hire a person with those credentials? Where would they create value?
This is such a ridiculous project - sidewalk - bot is taking the whole friggin' sidewalk in your video: I jump in the street with my walker, or with my baby stroller, or into the neighbor's yard, to let it go past? Ditto for the "navigate stairs" --> your bot is going up or down my stairs, while I am trying to go up or down, with a cane, or carrying my baby, or 2 bags of groceries, or whatever: i have to turn around and let the bot slowly make its way past me? Bot opens the door when I am not home, and what, zaps the home invader who was patiently following it and pushes its way past it inside my house? And you say there's gonna be a swarm of those descending on a neighborhood at delivery time? Nope  .   Dumb idea as described  .  
why pay a young person or underprivileged member of society who could use a job to make deliveries over small distances, when you could get a robot to do it? poorly at that, and while inconveniencing everybody who crosses its path, and generally sucking the dignity out of life  .   no, the real purpose of these awful "robots", which hilariously fail at the one thing they were designed to do, is masturbatory ~cyberpunk~ aesthetic-chasing and to be used as fodder for braindead college students' Instagram's  .   Pittsburgh is not silicon valley and vanity projects will not "put Pittsburgh on the map" any more than muh self-driving Ubers or machine-learning powered startups and rustic vegan axe-throwing craft pubs  .   nobody asked for this, and if you see one, you are morally obligated to tip on its back if not permanently disable it in some way, bean burritos be damned  .   this is the worst thing I've seen in a minute and i think I'm gonna go throw up now  .  
No, this is simply a testament to how lazy people are and stupid  .   Nobody is gonna buy this  .   I am a Silicon Valley Electrical Engineer, and I have seen so many stupid ideas and they always get promoted in a PR video, like this is  .   People are pathetic  .   It's just yet another scam  .   Yeah, it's much better to get food from a self driving robot that tops out at 10 kilometers an hour, than it is to get from a person, that tops out at 100 kph  .   That will keep it warm  .   You call this a convenience, and you tell me to get with the times  .   This is equivalent to getting food delivered by a horse and buggy  .   And this is in Berkeley, it won't take long before the homeless there figure out what it is, and simply destroy the damned thing and steal the food  .   And just for your information, I am not a boomer  .   I am generation X  .   I helped BUILD your times  .   See all the toys and gadgets you grew up with? I helped create them  .   Boomers didn't do anything except spread STD's during the 1960's  .   They were the most worthless generation this nation has ever seen  .  
Does that machine have rights it's AI technology this is where the law gets Gray and knows how to cross the street they thank you talk to people play music doesn't know the law? So if I kick it am I gonna jail for assault on what? If I knocked it over or steal it maybe I feel like helping it and think it's lost so I take it home? Does it have rights the owner has rights but does that have rights if it calls into an accident the owner gets in trouble right or is it the machine AI computer that gets charged with the accident think about this people this is the future both gonna have to be rewritten so we will wait till the day comes the day come it's here already set the bitching about cops you be bitching about machines writing you tickets locking you up   .   Get rid of the people interference then AI takes over who will you be able to pitch about oh it's a machine it's doing what it's programmed to do by man  .   AI technology is programmed yes but then it programs itself  learned self-taught what rules and what laws are you gonna b**** about when you got a robot walking around a enforcement the law?
Is this the future? Possibly  .   Is it worth it? I don’t think so  .   While we have UberEATS and other food delivery services available, they aren’t really great  .   Mainly because of the people aspect of the delivery  .   1) Delivery staff can take the money and call it a day while the customer gets nothing  .   The service may terminate the staff for failure to comply and theft  .   2) Delivery order can be ridiculously small and not worth the trip like that order of Starbucks  .   Not saying for this device but for the delivery service that uses people  .   The driver can just simply decline  .   The order and it may be handed to another driver who may pick it up, ultimately forcing a driver to make the trip and delivering the small order that probably took a large portion of the profit for gas  .   3) These delivery services are paid poorly  .   One might be fortunate to get a tip (if that’s how most services work) but I believe they just get a small delivery payment and the rest goes to the service which is really the sad part of these services  .   I believe that this will eventually replace people delivery drivers for those kinds of services as they are kind of better  .   Small, rechargeable, they look sturdy and are aware of their surroundings  .   Its the “ghetto” part of communities since they can be stolen and scavenged for parts  .   That is what worries me for these small buggers  .   Anyways, that’s just me and what I’ve seen in my community  .  
In my area, the vast majority of fast food deliveries are done by bike, some by electric bikes or electric scooters  .   These robots would, therefore, achieve one thing, unemployment  .   They also need to travel more slowly than a people on a bike, so food would not be as warm when it arrived  .   Some have commented on using these to deliver packages  .   Is it really a good idea to replace 1 driver in 1 car, who can be making 20 to 30 deliveries, with a greater number of these? I have my groceries delivered, the van drivers tell me that they make 8 to 10 deliveries per trip, and during a day will do 4 or 5 trips  .   These robots would need to be larger, divided into compartments with a chilled section and a frozen section, and a large number of units would be required to fulfil current demand  .   Even if roadways could, eventually, be reclaimed to provide more space for pedestrians, there would not be enough space for robots and people, especially as reclaimed roadways usually include space for bikes  .   There are many issues raised by this type of system: •Rural areas are not catered for  .   •In a CBD or an urban area with high rise accommodation, how do the robots access upper floors? If they don't, then it defeats the whole concept of deliveries, which are meant to be door to door  .   •People living in rougher areas would be unlikely to be served by these robots, as companies, like many taxi drivers now, would be unwilling to enter areas of risk  .   •If the robot stops for people, which they should, how, in a busy area, do they get anywhere without being stationary for half a trip  .   As far as I can see, these vehicles have a niche market, areas planned specifically for robots that overcome all of the problems that a contemporary city throws at them  .

Wow nice version and good job kiwibot friend
what a cute face KiwiBot v2 shows us
Sad thing I am gonna help it
The future is now! Great work  .  
Whoever added the eyes deserves a raise  .  
Starship is the best, order almost daily
It will shock you if you try probably
They seal the food in the robot now
The robot is already proving success though  .  
The robot does not attack anybody  .  
You’re not paying for fuel  .  
Yeah, that was so cute :D
They are locked  .   Also they have alarms
This is so cute!!! lol
that robot is cute when is driving now
Work really well here me getting a delivery
humans are dumb they need robots to help
damn, this little robot is a cutie
Okay, that's pretty ' neat  .  
these are honestly helpful because of the pandemic
I like the look of the amazon scout
I want it but i live in use
the law stop someone's from stealing it  .  
Why do I feel sentimental to these things
They are superior to humans at delivery  .  
This is beyond hilarious This made my day
Interesting on the service seems a good idea
People tried and it will literally start screaming
They are so cool aren’t they?
I love it when they say thank you
All that's so cool we like that
That is  .   THE CUTEST THING ON EARTH
It might create more jobs of designing them
So cute I want one as a pet
watch this Robot very interesting

They are the most adorable things I swear
My Gods, these are so cute!
I think it would be fine honestly
a little clunky but I like it  .

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?? Help them!
Welcome to the future  .    .  stay tuned for more
We have them in Milton Keynes England pretty cool
Anyone else think those robots are so cute lol
I love the origin story of these robots
yet  .   The robot does not attack anyone YET
Totally reasonable and not at all unhinged response  .  
should be wish the robot would run him over
This would be so great for traffic congestion  .  
How adorable  .   They should have they individual name
awesome   .  UK delivery is so high tech   .  
If you try to touch it starts a alarm
Clearly smarter than humans when crossing the street  .  
So adorable like real life Wall-E but delivering food
it can cross the street wow!!!
It has gaps and they will find you :3
Yeah they are small and cute i love that
Oh wow  .   That's pretty cool  .  
now i know why they made them cute lol
I will give you a hand little buddy
He is too cute, aww asking to pass  .  
SO CUTE let Mr. robot pass mean people
Ahah I hear you, they are cute!
I am adoring a tech now  .   Help  .  
Make company public  .   I want buy some stocks
George Mason University also has these little guys!
The Starship robots look insanely cute and adorable  .  
A ha  That's hot that's hot  .  
I Love Robot   .   And this is amazing idea
I am investing in this company in the future
But the disabled can still benefit from the robot
They are all great for my business 2022 and More
I like Starship’s cute little robot  .  
They have cameras and will catch the thieves  .  
lol! The eyes of the robots are cute
Very cool tech  .   Robots are the future!
Loved the robot — incredibly cute and efficient  .  
This is really fun! Thanks for sharing it
I love these little things thanks for filming it
OH my! How cute is that?!
Canada here , Never seen it before Pretty cool
Yes seen them year ago , funny little things
These are in my neighborhood and we love them
Aww, that thing is cute like you  .  
Possibly more polite than an average person nowadays  .  
Can't wait to see this in action!
Oh! It's very easy to travel to market
It is useful to deliver food to dorms  .  
Dude why did I nearly cry for that robot
Poor thing  .   I feel so bad for it
Awesome! Now I am hungry for Wings!
I saw the cute this weekend in Pleasanton  .  
Its quicker just to walk for fish and chips
i love robots too  .  take care always!
Thank you, they’re great helpful  .  
So cool unique galling easy to order food stuff
Nice! On which campus does it delivers?
great if it was also in Poland greetings :P
This is so fun, I love it so cute
I am confused, why not help the thing?
Irrelevant, people getting deliveries is all that matters  .  
They did now I think this is the reason why
I guess this is perfect for all the Non tippers
Nothing cool about a robot being kicked over too  .  
There will always be improvements with robots no worries  .  
That's so uncool I would or kicked him over
don’t do that lol you might get arrested
can't be stolen, got gaps tracker on it
So many people on this channel think this is good
I want to develop this further! PM me!
I want to help the poor guy!!!
poor thing  .   Did you end up helping it?
Yes, deliberately cute to make them appealing and acceptable 
poor robot  .   wallllieee ambush the food isn't right
Lol, I was seriously tempted to pet it too
We need these in Glasgow ASAP!!!!
yep I love having it round mine in Milton Keynes
the kiwibot is so cute don’t you think
yeah it’s pretty useful because of the pandemic
I second that for more laws to protect the robots
I like these robots there like little public mini pets
Aww they say "thank you"  .   So cute
people helping robots even more  .  , people creating robots
even if these are just robots they are adorable asf
That’s so cool  .   Thank you for sharing
Yeah  .   its good where uber can't go  .  
This is cool, wish we had them here  .  
it starts screaming  .   We had these at my school
I want to meet one they’re well cool
Great footage Sure everyone will enjoy this one absolutely great
They seem to be more intelligent than most humans  .  
I was there last week lol they are so cool
He's a lot nicer than people in my city lol
That's the cutest thing I have ever seen  .  
Even kids can order just like in school cafeteria yay
i want this please send to kumbakonam arasu engineering college
Starting at bugs campus soon!! Very exciting  .  
Omg, it's so cute!!!!
I’m literally crying this is just too sad
At least you don't have to tip it  .  
Hahaha this is so cool!!!!!
they have alarms and cameras all round on them  .  
Cool The fed ex robot looks like the best one
They screech when you try to open them without unauthorized access
I have feelings for the robot , man I feel bad
I am just gonna put a wall-e sticker on it
oh yeah, nothing could ever go wrong with this  .  
It has cameras and a GPS to track its location  .  
the robot is a little confused but it got the spirit
love these things, I wish we had them here  .   
It actually has a cold compartment and a hot compartment!
that's so mean burh let it do it's work
Happy to see I'm not the only one seeing that  .  
it already works and they will scale soon
That's a cool ice chest for the cold ones
Aww, I am sure he would love some empathy ️
C'mon , but you got to admit there are fuckin' cute  .  
Ah yes the nice cute robots that help out the world
True chances are they be used in low crime areas  .  
I really hope those eyeballs are still on that robot  .  
So cute! Reminds me of Johnny 5 or batteries not included
I didn't even know that they could do this!
This cute thing makes me less scared of robots taking over
“I run on love”  .   Love it!!
i can't believe we started to think robots are cute
You will see cops catching thieves catching Amazon scouts during Xmas))
I love these little guys  .   They are so cool  .  
Our city actually has these robots which is cool i guess
please take care of them! they are absolutely adorable!
Pros: Testing New Technologies help us live easily and cheaper
It has a distance operator that talks to pedestrian through a speaker
It happened to me when I and my brother helped it
That's bad why don't you pick that robot ?
Such a great idea  .   I can't wait until its everywhere
I don't know why but that robot is so cute
Well , it can carry a lot more than a people  .  
Hmm  .   Nice and cool  .   Kudos to the tech   .  
they are overprotected.   you cant turn it off or open it  .  
looks great  .  any stolen or damaged by careless people ?
When a cooler robot is more civilized than a people driver  .  
The future is now in Colombia ! Great work  .   Lol
Cool! I have never seen robots do that before!
Omg they’re like minions Dave and his buddies super cute
It would be so fun being the person to control Coco!
I have no clue, I really want to see them more
I would stomp his dog so he knows how the robot feels  .  
Hope he pays for it, pretty sure this is very expensive
I’m sure it has gaps for easy recovery if stolen
Never mind just saw it gets locked until it arrives at its destination
that is cruel, you can't turn the robot upside!
the company will have already constructed a map that avoids known limitations
In Singapore, they’ll catch the thief within 2 working days
That's the future! It's a really good investment  .  
if it is apparently post mates will track you down w/ the police
try to create a robot that auto maneuvers in sidewalks in GREECE
Voan Siam upgrades and can tip itself over like Boston dynamics robots
Exactly like bruh they so cute I can't hurt them things
They will find a solution to this  .   Don't worry  .  
Oh poor guy, he must be fear of crossing streets  .  
I actually feel concerned for them going out late at night  .  
What an amazing time to be alive, these things are fantastic
Came from the train hitting one of these little dudes  .   RIP
They have cameras, you would be eating jail food soon  .  
The robots have alarms and cameras and lock closed as anti-theft measures
Just a idea could be good for security watch in areas  .  
The girl crying because it says thank you would totally be me
people seem to like them enough to help if they get stuck
If it’s for saving lives it should be good  .  
Hahahaha that's so awesome  .   i hope they gave him a tip
That is an incredible invention  .   Wish I had 1 to myself  .  
Well now, that's about the cutest thing!!!
what a great idea !!! said no one ever  .  
Amazon Scout in Desperate Housewives' Wisteria Lane!!!!!
He is so cute I want to carry the stuff for him
so cute  .   no one wants to crack it in USA  .  
Since it’s only for this campus it must be reliable
These robots are the cutest things I ever seen :,))️️
ABBA!? That Robot got some good taste in music!
poor little robot, he died doing what he loved most  .  
Los Angeles has coco which is a beautiful bright color robots!
I WAS gonna SAY HEY I SEEN THESE IN MODESTO LOL
SO Cute  .  Gonna order every day & gonna hug them
This looks so fun! Nice idea for a delivery service!
Nice, I hope I also have a Robot like that hehehe
That’s a great invention very helpful specially during this pandemic
this is now the primary reason I wish I had gotten into Berkeley
Push them out one by one i do not care how low it takes do it
When it said I love you to the robots it was so cute
Actually it’s not expensive  .   Yandex takes care about this  .  
Exactly  .   Poor robot man seriously people like that I want to throttle
Yep exactly agree 100% and the majority of people on the internet actually agree
I love the idea! Innovative and cost-effective and safe (I  .  e  .   Covid)
I’m just now seeing this in Delta and it was cool
And you will be in prison if you turn the robot upside down
the final version will be able to claim stairs and use most elevators
The robots are not stupid things at least the robot is smarter than you
Too cute I would love Robot at my door would make you smile
Bahahaha poor grocery Wall-E! He was such a nice robot :’(
My Mom's birthplace -- Northampton, England! WOW! Cute!
oh wow! Hope to see it in Mountain View too!
I am the only 1 that thinks those robots look so cute driving around
That’s kind of scary  .   Got to be careful with them  .  
Much Easier to have Food delivered to College Students  .   Oh yeah  .  
These should be available all over the country, not just Milton Keynes
Pretty sure it calls the police on you if you try nicking it
They are great for people who are unable to get out though  .  
I don't know why, but that's robots are very cute
These things have cameras, GPS tracking and they have a loud alarm
I can just imagine somebody tipping them over like a beached whale  .  
Cute, if you think a picnic cooler on wheels is cute  .  
Wish they didn’t look like minions but cool idea for sure
We have these in the uk really cool little robots and funny too
Glad I am not the only one who want to stalk them!
is it weird that i find it cute as fuck hahahah madness though
I use them all the time in Bedford  .   They are brilliant!
these robots probably have defense mechanisms of some sort, maybe like GPS
Very cute  .   Until they tell you about service fees and gratuity  .  
What a world where were calling Robots cute and having dialect with them
there's no way I'm tipping a robot I'm saving 5 bucks per delivery  .  
NOOOOOO!!! Bro he just wanted to deliver some food man
I would rather have a robot deliver my groceries than Door dash  .  
Amazing technology  .  very intelligent and brilliant idea  .  I love this robot delivery
"Enemy RC-XD spotted!"  .   These are so adorable!
that's cool!!  .  sure would save on delivery tips!!
That is so cute  .   You’re so sweet to that robot!
just a robot? not just a robot bruh, second they are cute
They are so cute  .   I love seeing them , here they are pink
We have them in San Jose ca and they seem to be okay  .  
This would be Great! if we lived in a world without assholes!
Because of people like you, we can't have nice things, feels bad man
Anyone that attacks these cute little cinnamon buns have no soul  .  
Oh yea i went there and it was funny seeing robots on the street
THIS is the future  .   I was advocating delivery robots more than 20 years ago
FedEx Roxo Bot seems to have the best navigation and movement via AI!
Is it just me who finds those really cute I want to have 1 lol
I thought Tesla FSD was innovative! This is where it started!!
This is awesome  .   I hope they don’t attack that thing  .  
We had a little bit of fun with this cute little intelligent machine  .  
the sad thing is these bots are more polite then most people these days
I’m excited for us to reduce reliance on cars for delivery!
Estonia has been doing this for a while, and it works fine there
damn wish they had this when i was at UCI , i graduated in 2017
I would stalk that robot too :D, that's freaking awesome!
I LOVE THOSE ROBOT I WISH MY COUNTRY WHOULD HAVE THIS!!!
I would get along better with this robot than the average people being  .  
I would get along better with this robot than the average people being  .  
I am gonna need a whole train of these guys for my groceries
wait, so the robot lids are electronically locked? That’s smart
I love this new technology I hope I live forever to see it all
No the poor little robot people need to respect the little robot these days
it is locked and it turns on an alarm if some one touches it
Maybe a 360 view camera connected to a VR goggle  .   This is cool  .  
Looking forward to when a people won't need to supervise the robot  .  
Who knows what will happen in the future, but some good points here
Wow! Well thanks for the information, that's actually really interesting  .  
I talked to one today and it didn’t talk back to me lol
I can imagine the headline, Homeless man sexually assaults robot, film at 11 !
what a piece of shit, ruining some ones food or drink!!!
Ahah maybe, though they are very  careful when crossing (even too careful!)
Can't wait to see them here in Germany  .   They are so cute  .  
If I see someone doing that I'm getting my gun out and calling the cops
Them tiny robots are so cute  .   I always help them in the winter  .  
That it will be very useful to not virus spread between the people's
I can find 40+ thousand people who agree with you that the robot is really cute
What about old people on their retirement? Do you call them lazy too?
I respect it ill fight any cocky mf who think they could rob the robot
Ahh I am glad I am not the only one that thinks robots are cute
It's sad that the robots are more nice and polite than people being  .  
Just purchased food with this just to try it  .   Had to much fun  .  
Amazing! The robots are more polite than the people who live in Kempston  .  
Nice of y'all to help, poor thing would have been stuck waiting all day  .  
I love you, Scout  .   I really hope to see you soon, again
I'm a guy and I think they are cute too haha  .  
It's like a robot dog  .   It's just so cute to me  .  
That music you talking and seeing the robot delivering food to people made me happy
It's not useless  .   It serves as a testing phase for further development  .  
It's a cute delivery robot using technology that has existed for a while  .  
They’re waterproof! Snow could be tricky if it’s deep!
Okay…  .   who cares? I’m still using it to get my food delivered
There's nothing ridiculous about robots  are cool and robots is here to stay!
I order from Starship almost everyday  .   Way better than other delivery apps  .   Congrats!
What a loser and he's wearing a mask too  .   Hope he doesn't breed
Pretty soon, leftists will be demanding that we give the bots "rights  .  "
This will be good for businesses who have employees that call off all the time  .  
It has cameras all around and can carry 22 lbs of food so stop bashing it  .  
Oh wow, would love to learn more! Want to do an interview? :)
Its locked and unlocked via the app  .   My sister used it to get her dinner
It is so great robot to help people and it will be strong in future!
Lol, they will likely have gps tracking on them not too mention all the cameras
to be honest they prob created it because it’s Purdue which is a highly advanced school
Did anybody else find it cute when it stopped and looked up at the statue?
I’ve never seen anyone vandalize the robots and I see them all the time
I guess that, like OnStar, it can be opened remotely by the sender  .  
It's has a laser if people touch it you will wish you never did  .  
People are dangerous but these cute robots are just so cute and harmless
I love how the kind people keep treating the robot as a people or a animal
Why do I feel so bad for them when they wreck they’re so polite
Yes it is  .   But at the same time it's just so adorable  .   Lol
Yes, because you are a closed mind set individual that's scared of change  .  
Hi Morton  .   as a Software Developer by my education I find them neat! :)
I want one and I will name him R2D2 and we will have so many adventures
OMG! That's the cutest thing I have ever seen!!! Adorable!
Chances are there's a gps inside as well as the ability to lock itself  .  
good thing for all you scum that don't know how to tip your delivery driver  .  
That's cool! I hope it doesn't get run over by a train  .  
This is Amazing! I love Door Dash so much  .   Life saver for my family of 4
Dude I love the future! “Hello, I’m a starship robot”
Wow that's amazing, robot delivery is surely a safer thing especially this time  .  
they have cameras indicated around those machines, it could probably detect who someone is as well
so  .   that autonomous vehicle uses tech just like you would find in  .   autonomous vehicles  .  
only in Santa Monica !!!! well done ! my first time seeing Coco !
Aww I want one of those as a little pet I’ll feed it batteries!
This is why we can't have nice things, because of ae holes like this guy
It could be anyone who learns how to drive one  .   Not only for tech people  .  
they’ve been around for a year or two  .   not many cases of vandalism surprisingly
This is delightful! We are from the UK and we know Castro Street very well!
Imagine a cute, round robot rolling up into the hood? "Hi everybody!"
My first time seeing one ever, so amazing, and that was very nice of yours
Luckily those "assholes" would have a hard time doing anything bad to the robot  .  
UM  .   where's MINE? and best part don't have to TIP IT :p
Yeah I got so excited when I saw the model is a wave and say hi robots
I was not expecting for the kiwi bike to be self driving too, nice!!
Awesome, now I hardly ever have to worry about my food possibly being picked at  .  
Human: Hey! Robot: Yeah whatever, take your food Also they are so cute
the robots don't get sick or call in sick & check their watches at 4:55pm like you  .  
Yea it seems really wholesome, can’t wait to see these in town again!
I just realized those Starship robots are well mannered compared to some of us people beings  .  
seen this in other cites funny when 1st see it   .  wait to see loads them together its crazy
humans are good people  .   no one would ever see one of those and steal it  .  
they have these little robots at as now  .   I love seeing them zoom around campus :)
it has tracker, alarm, camera  .  you will be in jail if you want to steal them
Not a single robot has been stolen in Estonia yet  .   It will sound an alarm  .  
I was in Pleasanton yesterday and saw these guys at the light… I was totally fascinated!
Hi, thanks for your comment, they’re very popular and helpful with deliveries  .  
Omg its so cool  .   Haha amazing I'm so amaze high technology really takes place peoples job
I would have backed up and finished the job  .   Teach robot not to cross at wrong time
These things can be awesome!   .  As long as they don't take people's jobs  .  
Geno Green they have cameras on them so if they get vandalized they will know who did it
Amazing how all the of sudden there's robots; it doesn't take a fucking genius!
I saw one of these in Austin, Tx yesterday and I found it so stinking cute  .  
Don’t want to misgender coco but I leaning on she’s a female coco  .  
It actually has a qi code the order has to scan in order for it to open  .  
we need a volunteers with an app that can help these little guys that are getting stuck sometimes
It’s only so big so it do the small stuff most delivery drivers refuses to do
They’re in Northampton but I’m waiting for them to come to my local co-op
I think this looks really interesting and there are a lot of people who will benefit from this
They need this in the hospitals for guests of patients that don’t want to leave room
yeah, we really are gonna the future  .   and yeah this technology is really great,
The FedEx one is the fastest and could go up our steps to deliver it to your door
The amazon and the FedEx one they are real great plus the other refrigerator it's awesome  .  
Yup FedEx bot wins for me, when will it be available? - Montreal, Quebec, Canada-
The robot Mart will most definitely be a force to be reckoned with in this new economy  .  
What are you talking about? She is just expressing happy emotions over the robot being cute  .  
I watched it again from the beginning for that cute robot sci‐fi to reality factor! Haha  .  
Ah, whether we like it or not, automation is the future  .   Robot is super cute
Okay, now you make me want to drive over to UCI and give it a try  .  
But it’s so cute!!!! No way I could be mad at them
that is so cool in about 4 to 5 years that will be the only way to get your shopping
The camera and security on the originals was good ,I would say that they have improved  .  
Why do I find these robots so cute?! I swear I’m so soppy!
AWESOME SHIT THESE ROBOTS !! THEY SAY WHAT THE ESTONIAN DEBIT Invented! EXACTLY moron !!
Saw my first one yesterday  .   Very cool  .   Maybe one day I will use the service  .  
Not true  .   I am at NAU and saw one go up a pretty good incline yesterday  .   
This is the best news in a long time  .   Its the future unfolding  .   Love it!
That's a really handy robot that we can use in our houses  .   Thanks for showing us
They have this built in tazer thing, it was on the ep of T pains school of business
The delivery robot is so cute  .   The look reminded me of the "robocon" in the 70s  .  
It has been in Shanghai for 3 years, Japan finally catch up  .   I feel happy for them  .  
Let’s just make robots for every jobs humanly possible  .   That will get the economy moving!
Hey I think some of this curbside and home delivery is here to stay  .   Robots sound great!
LOL go tell people to get off your lawn old man, you can’t stop the future
He has his dog off leash  .   He’s an irresponsible dog owner who probably beats his dog
some people think It’s a good idea it looks more of an idea than a joke  .  
Good! Robots don't steal food and I don't have to tip on an already expensive app
mark Rober solve that problem already  .   it involves glitter, fart spray, multiple cellphones and gps  .  
I use it to bring food to my apartment just have to go outside and get it though lol
It is for groceries not hot food deliveries, and it’s refrigerated or heavily insulated at least
These robots are so cute and helpful  .   I feel privileged to have their service in our neighborhood
Yeah this is why I love YouTube  .   I have never knew this existed until right now  .  
I like the way our future is rapidly expanding and coming super intelligent when it comes to helping mankind
I helped one because it got stuck and it said thank you I literally cried because it was adorable
Lazy? So your saying students who staying up all night studying and doing homework is being lazy?
It's a robot but I can't help but worry about it all on its own  .   Lol
There's a Tesco express I go to regularly and I love watching these negotiate the busy road  .  
They follow an autonomy level of 4, which is way smarter than any other delivery robot you can see
That would be an awesome life to have a robot that brings you beer to your bedroom! :)
It works in Estonia, which has snowy winters  .   so I think these robots can overcome the snow
Now if only the robots were shaped like Dinosaurs  .   that would be even cooler!
Honestly I think these robot's are a great idea, I think people are to expecting of robots
lol brilliant  .   I saw a robot grass cutting the other day, it was almost silent too  .  
that would be hilarious! And I hope it has a really cute little high-pitched voice like Wall-E!
Look up the there video on YouTube and it will explain how it's really hard to be stolen
I am waiting for Wall-E to come out of the bushes and roll after it  .   "Eeeeve-AHHHHH!"
It's integrated with gps you can expect an agent from post mates with the police if you get one hehe
If these cuties come to my town I will stay outside in the cold to help when it's needed
Ladies and gentlemen  .   the future!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why do I feel sad and empathy for a little programmed robot then I do for a delivery person?
But i mean it was made to deliver us food, and not steal our hearts, way too cute
Man I legit want to cry how cute this robot is I swear I have so much empathy for it
They have these at all robots where my brother went to his college camp  .   They’re so adorable
It has gps trackers and that thing is like a safe so yeah it also has a very loud alarm
Amazing  .   I wish that kind of service happened to me of where I go to school at  .   :)
fantastic !!!! ha ha ha  .   I would definitely order by robot!!
Lol I seen this first hand a few months ago by University of Pittsburgh  .   They were pretty cool!
They even say thank you for pressing the button at traffic lights and can play music  .    .  mind blown haha
Idk what that is but it's neat, cute, and very useful for old people and disabled people
can we use this video to upload in our YouTube channel ??? It's pretty good really  .  
I am very interested in this company , contacted them about a great idea and partnership  .   Yet to hear back
I am sure they have more than enough robots  .   They are far more efficient than having a delivery driver  .  
So cute! I am worried they will be hit by a car or be crushed or destroyed by mean people
I think the point of using them is to minimize people contact because of covid, its a much safer alternative
Guess these things will be more helpful than ever since everyone is stuck at home because of the Covid-19 pandemic  .  
GPS tracker, camera, Speakers where ppl monitor the device and call the police  .   go ahead and steal it
The Robots are so little and cute  .   It almost makes me feel bad for them when they fall over  .  
The industrial revolution was a break in the trends of history  .   Automation will be the same  .  
robots are the future  .   I cant wait to buy McDonalds without ever leaving the house, also grocery shopping  .  
It’s too cute to be harmed, it needs to go hella fast just in case in an emergency
It’s not useless  .   come on I know you can more open minded than that I believe in you!
Amazing starship robot! Wow! High tech deliver food  .   Thanks for sharing this  .   God bless  .  
We let him go  .   We weren't really trying to catch him  .   That's the future of food delivery  .  
So a dick the men who kicks the robot  .   Why he not teach the dog and where is the leash of the dog  .  
I had a good experience with it and I also did a video for the starship robot delivery on my channel  .  
That's so awesome!! I saw those the other day but didn't know what they were for They are cute
Why? It's the only one that can go through potholes and climb stairs  .   I think you need better glasses
There all so cute  .   I just want to keep them safe and make sure they get to there destination safe  .  
It works , I live in Milton Keynes and have had these for a few months now and they work great  .   
lol, the future is here! We should use this to do curbside book delivery at the Mission Viejo Library!
This is the life I want to see  .   Robotic workers and delivery is so cool and the way of the future
Starship were great during covid and lockdown they deliver all sorts now from Starbucks to co op  .   They even deliver beer
I always knew I was living in the future  .   I am actually from the 80s and I am mind blown by this stuff
Did anyone see the one where it thanked someone for getting it un stuck? That’s a feel good video
This another for the company to keep more profits  .   by cutting drivers out, your food cost want go down  .   
I loved the way Jimmy called the robot 'he' instead of 'it' as if the robot is really people  .   LOL!
These delivery robots are great aren't they! I like to help them up the kerb if they have a problem ️
Yeah well most other humans are assholes but no one should go hungry so I’ll help the little robot deliver food
I don’t know why but they are so cute!! Their like little truck drivers or wall-e’s hahaha
Hi starship, any plans that robot will go little faster? I just love this product, but its only going 6km/h?
these are all high school teenagers now, doing their first summer jobs  .   wait for them to grow up in future  .  
The car running over the poor robot who was just minding his own business AND had the right of way pisses me off
would have those as my talking partner, and wander around the house for amusement, man it feels sad without being rich
It's just a business trying to make it with a new opportunity  .   Just let the little guys run on by  .  
We literally took delivery from one in Cambourne  .   they are so clever and will even sing a song when they arrive  .  
Pretty sure and investment like this has a GPS tracker you all  can turn it down a notch it's probablly fully thought out
I love these diligent little men  .   Keep going little guys, you’re just vibing and doing a great job  .  
we have them in my city  .   they’re pretty cool, they actually use the crosswalks it’s hilarious  .  
"I am Door Dash"   .    .  He reminds me of Groot for some reason  .   Probably just because they are both adorable!
It's part of learning  .   Once the robot has learnt enough, it can use the learnt experience for future unchaperoned delivery
This was exactly my 1st thought as well, "hmm so easy for anyone to take the packages or harm the robot"  .  
These delivery robots always surprise and put a smile to my face whenever I am walking round MK recording our videos too! :)
Oh I had no idea! Would be fun to see a video of them! Why don't you share it? :)
wow  .   This is interesting  .   I am having a hard time picturing it, but you should share a video/photo of it!
it is really nice and now it's fun to see all these robots roaming around!
I had a real and good experience with it and I also did a video for the starship robot delivery on my channel  .  
I’m so mad that they done have these in the uk and USA instead, they are my new favorite thing now
They are mostly autonomous , GPS operated pretty much like how your phone shows you what way to go when you navigate somewhere  .  
They can just build it like a safe-on-wheels  .   Thief will need hundreds of dollars worth of equipment to steal someone's lunch  .  
Felt sad with the starship bot who got hit and got his wheels damaged, hope he gets repaired instead of being trashed  .  
I know it's just a cooler with a GPS shoved up its ass, but I kind of feel like we could be friends
I’ve had a few of these robots deliver to me  .   They’re great, aren’t they!?
That's Pretty Cool Wonder if they do Medicine to the Elderly too   .   Less traffic and More Jobs in your Local Area   .  
Imagine we see more off these later on , be delivery everything! It will be really great thing for humanity done by robot
The Coco delivery bots are much cuter  .   I saw them whizzing around Santa Monica this evening  .   So cool and so cute!
I don't know why but i found it so cute   .   like a baby or a little chicks especially by crossing road hahaha
Just wait, the moment when self driving cars are the norm, service lanes for robots like these will be there as well
Its better that an electric delivery robot goes slowly down sidewalks, than people picking up their deliveries in dangerous personally driven cars  .  
wow really nice I salute how advance their technology is  .  so convenient whenever you want to order  .  you can order anytime  .  
I am in London and I still haven't seen one yet, hopefully they will be there soon because they look so cool!
They have 360 degree cameras and trackers, I bet if you stole one you would get your image captured and a location alert sent  .  
If I was walking nearby I would pick it up real quick instead of making a huge scene out of it and just standing there
They use them here in my town at Purdue University  .   They work really well and they get around in the snow amazingly well  .   
First time I have seen any of these and I was surprised at how funny they are  .   One and two are the best  .  
in my country we only have car delivery in rural areas  .   delivery drivers use bikes  .   i would use robot delivery too i think
I see these on the ASU campus all the time, but I never knew what they actually delivered until now  .   Very cool!
I would use it because I know all my food would be in the bag and not partially eaten by a delivery driver!
lol I saw you filming this in front of the WPU!! These robots are kind of dumb, but damn are they cute!
this think had surrounding camera, tracker, alarm system and lock system   .   trying to steal from it will let you into a trouble
I am living in Estonia, it is a normal scene to see robots walking in the street ,,, So cute :D
Or they put a lock on the robot and the customers could only unlock it and there will be a tracker if someone steals it
These should be useful for elderly people who can't go out to shop and people who are sick to go out to shop  .  
Please make kiwi shopping center bot that takes it from the shopping center to the trike and I want to trial it in Lincoln UK  .  
these have been operating since 2018 and have been incredibly successful  . 
i saw one of these things delivering food yesterday for the first time  .  the reaction of the dogs made my day, lol priceless!
For us this is new and probably mind blowing, its interesting to me how new generations will think this is normal and probably outdated lol
Enough with the word "future"! Too much regulation, this needs to be now! Everything is in place, lets go!
it also made a video about you, funny watching you run around like you do when you could get a robot to do it  .  
0:17 the robot literally looks up by lifting itself to see who or what that is  .   It’s kind of cute how it does it  .  
I like the first food delivery bot with it's low center of gravity, but best of all  .   it won't expect a Tip
they didn't account for me  .   bot protector  .   armed with my trusty wits and 3kilo baseball bat i protect the bots from wrongdoers and villains
I love these little carts, I feel so sad when I see one on it’s own, in the dark and rain . 
In minutes your crib gets raided the robot is tracked at all times, only those dumbest criminals think like that, cameras on the thing
It wouldn’t as they have instant switches so if someone takes it automatically sends it’s location none stop to local law enforcement
Hi team, very cool tech  .   I have shown your video to my MBA students in Smart Cities and in my column in Brazil  .  
I guarantee you those things will be either heavy, or come with an alarm  .   Don't think the designers haven't thought about it  .  
Delivery cute robot: "What is my purpose?" Student: "You pass food" Delivery cute robot: "ohh my  .  "
Thank you very much Gary, I am sure would make it, because a lot of research was done before they have tried them out  .  
it has its own map and navigation and can stop and turn and move on its own pretty dope this is just the beginning of AI
Delivery cute robot: "What is my purpose?" Student: "You pass food" Delivery cute robot: "ohh my  .  "
My mum and I were driving to go swimming and saw one of these! It made our day and put a smile on our face
Truthfully cars had the same if not more problems then these bots when they first came out it’s only a matter of time!!
Just amazing! I want one  .   To bring me beers  .   To my bedroom  .   Where I stay  .   I have a pitiful life !
Cool aren't they?! They just came to Bedford, the town over, and I popped up a video about them on Monday!
Why are you late? "Because i was stopped by the traffic and couldn't cross the road, but luckily a girl helped me"
why do they look so  .   cute? I’m finding robots on wheels delivering food cute  .   I need to get my shit together  .  
This will be amazing for the elderly  .  i never know this existed  .  get this in buffalo Ny ASAP   .  there are senior homes people can use this  .  
I’m sure people jogging on the street will totally respect these robots just like they respect people life and other people’s property  .  
Great video, I have used the robots as well  .   We love them  .   I see them all the time these days while out and about  .  
The locks are pretty though and it's pretty difficult to pry open a moving box  .   Also don't forget all the cameras and the GPS  .  
Me, the guy whose job it is to stop you from trying to ride on it or take the merchandise  .   I'm what's to stop you!
big if but if they can catch you, you will be prosecuted for destruction of property that was not even yours to destroy to begin with  .  
I seen them in Northampton, quite a few times  .   Me and my mum thinks it is adorable  .   I want one as a pet   .  
I see no issues with this at all  .   I don't think anyone would kick it over for a laugh or steal it and your delivery  .  
not true the big one can store way more food without squishing it up and no one could pick it up and run like in the other video
They have built in cameras folks  .   I am sure they can send a mug shot of a vandal directly to the police as it is being kidnapped
Thank you very much , yes this legit the Co-op are rolling them out in certain places  .   Our Co-op has 6 of these Robots have a wonderful Wednesday  . 
EXACTLY like a responsible dog owners should  .   If I was that person filming I would kick him in the balls  .   Poor robot had a job to do
it would be nice if they were completely autonomous, but hey, that's already very good for a food delivery robot that's not a drone!
Am I the only one that felt anthropomorphic empathy and scared for the little "guy" as he slowed and paused at the intersections? Nicely done!
It's a little creature trying to do his job and be part of this world, but the world is full of obstacles  .   Maybe this sounds familiar
I don’t know why these little robots bring out such a maternal desire in me, I want to hold it and help it across the street
Had to stop my artic to let one of these cross the road in Brinklow, Milton Keynes  .   Utterly amazing and I want one to bring me food
I love how they might be programmed to yell "I require assistance!" when it detects it's at a certain angle or it is confused  .  
Hey  .   I live in Milton Keynes  .   These are great little inventions; I think the company that makes these work with co-op and small Tesco stores  .  
I’ve never seen this before  .   How very Green  .   Greener than a diesel delivery van left with its engine running all day spewing out carcinogens  .  
Not having to be obligated to tip someone to do  their job is more than enough reason for me to be excited for this kind of thing  .  
Srsly please move forward with so they can ban jobs and humans can just enjoy the outside or life with no worries just have Robots do it!!
we’re still fascinated by these robots, i think they’re brilliant  .   I remember everyone taking the mick out of the roundabouts and cows!
They just added about 25 of these to my University, as with anything it’s got a learning curve but it looks to work fine in our environment  .  
lol, there's only a few of these robots  .   they will not replace humans, also they do the deliveries that people don't want to take  .  
These little dudes are absolutely fantastic I have a whole channel dedicated to them Life is so much better when a little 6 wheeled Bot can bring you a little happiness
This would be an absolute boon to my mum in Clacton  .   She's disabled and housebound, and has had trouble getting Tesco delivery slots during this pandemic  .  
there are thousands of job fields out there  .   just go to school  .   we don't need to valuable waste man power on "walking boxes to doors  .  "
Slightly biased video  .   These things can be useful for those who cannot travel well  .   The elderly, the handicapped, mom with a kid to watch  .  
They have gps and cameras to help battle that issue  .   They are also tracked and monitored from a HQ who call the police if needed for criminal damage  .  
The George Mason campus has them all over  .   My brother goes there, and whenever I go, I love seeing these things they’re so cute!
Well it's connected by GPS and they stream the video to a computer which saves it  .   So I don't think you can get away with it  .  
also, that would be an even better reason for these robots to exist  .   If food courier wasn’t a sustainable job, let robots do it instead  .  
The robot is built to be tough, it takes a while to break into it while all the cameras are recording you and the GPS is tracking your location  .  
This tech will follow the path of the cell phone  .   Expensive, clunky and sub par performance at first and as time goes by it will eventually be ubiquitous  .  
With the amount of anti-theft measures built in on them, I highly doubt it  .   Unless those douchebags want to serve jail time for a small bag of groceries  .  
I love this robot it's cute to see them in Milton Keynes I love having them round my house you should make big one what can do all your shopping
With the On Board GPS and Camera's All over to see you  .   You will be Charged with Grand Larceny  .  A Thief's Dream!!!!!
no  .   it has camera's all over it and the top is locked until you confirm it arrived on your phone  .   if u pick it up an alarm sounds
This is very interesting  .   I would like to know what they plan to do about dealing with ice and snow  .   Are those wheels gonna have enough traction?
Thank you very much Emi for your view, these Robots are very new, so maybe I will do an update in a few months time  .   Have a wonderful Thursday  .  🇬🇧🇺🇸
Oh WOW!I wonder if our local Co-op will show this robot too  .  Haha  .  It's fun  .  Was the boy your Grandson next to the robot? Thanks Dennis, enjoy your Wednesday  .  
Ahah I seriously doubt they would survive in a Robot war And, yes, they are very scared/conservative towards pedestrians and they do a pretty good job at respecting the signs
ahah yes, they are! I would just want them more assertive when crossing the streets, but cute indeed  .   Everyone stops to look at them and take pix :)
its quite funny actually, I am reading all these pessimistic comments made '2 years ago' unyet, these things are now literally on every street in the city where i work  .  
I think the point is that the delivery with robots are potentially cheaper, so you can pay extra for the 12th floor delivery or save some money and go down 12 floors  .  
Good to see image of bot coming to door to make delivery  .   Mobility issues make gonna the curb difficult  .   Same mobility issues create the need for transportation services  .  
I see a need for more laws, like a penalty for interfering in a robots path and an increased penalty for vandalizing them since they are vulnerable to immature pranksters  .  
I would like to think I am the kind of person who would help it out, but it's also really funny to watch them fall, so who knows?
some of them all do is watch, I pity the robots even though it has no life, it looks cute and innocent and tried it's best to successfully deliver
Alarms go off and staff or police turn up in a van  .   They have GPS and so many cameras streaming back to base  .   They are automated but have people controllers
To the people saying it would just get stolen dude it probably has advanced GPS, hidden air tags, and there's a myriad of other fucking anti theft methods  .  
why is this the cutest thing I’ve ever seen?!? It’s like a cute little guy just doing his little job  .   Carry-on, soldier!
Thank you very much, yes these Robots will be rolled out( forgive the pun) all around the country soon  .   Keep an eye out at your nearest CO-OP Have a wonderful Thursday  .
Lmao, you are so funny  .   It's not like the robot can get tracked and traced  .   It's because of people like you we can never have nice things  .  
I have never ever shopped in coop (i have only 1 shop around and anyway far enough so i need to drive)  .   If they launched those in my city, I would  .  
Very interested to see into the hardware of one of these  .   Been using a lot of LiDAR recently in My own robotics project and definitely wanting to look into more autonomous robotics  .  
Great idea for everyone, especially the aged and disabled  .   In some neighborhoods it might need an armed escort! Let’s hope not Way better idea than GPS drones  .   
How good would it be to own one of these? Order online, then send it off to the local shop/takeaway, they fill it and send it back to you  .  
Nice delivery robot that *will save a lot of driving in traffic  .  * Good for early morning and night time deliveries, when people are actually at home to get the package  .  
You NEVER have to give a tip  .   Drivers for UberEATS make little money and get no tips  .   Kimmel did tell them to tip the robot though, that was nice  .  
These things are fantastic, and the people who complain about them potentially taking their jobs need to take a deep long look at themselves, be better the bar isn't that high
These are amazing  .   So fricking cute  .   We can across one today for the first time ever  .   From Glasgow so didn't even know these existed  .   OMG I am in love
Those are cool  .  i like FedEx one best  .   This won't out drivers out of work, it will make their jobs easier  .   This technology is years behind replacing drivers  .  
They do have an audio system and can talk to you, say if they get knocked over they say help me and when you do correct there position they say thank you  .  
That is so  Cool - now this is stuff i want to see - they way of the future  .   I like it! it will work best on campuses - like school or work  .  
That's so cool! But are they not afraid of some one stealing them or breaking them to steal the food??? But then again once stolen what will they do with?
A lot of delivery robots are built like tanks  .   By the time you break it open the product inside will probably already be ruined and a tracking signal would have been sent out  .  
Yes it will  .   So-called smart phone alerts you your delivery (bugs and plastic food) will arrive shortly  .   Driverless van turns up  .   Use phone to unlock bay, and away it goes!
Nice one  .   Many like that in all UK 🇬🇧 and all Europe 🇪🇺 very nice  .   Greetings whit my all family from Leicester UK 🇬🇧  .   God bless  .   All the best   .   Take care   .  
Thank you very much Selina, yes the future is Robotic delivery  .   At the moment it is just the Co-op in Rusden and Hingham   .   You will see them soon  .   Have a wonderful Wednesday  .
it's so cute I want one in my city, but I know it's impossible  .   God, I need to get away from here asap and go to a city that has starship
I liked FedEx best he could actually climb upstairs and it has good speed but if it used to starships technology and know how similar they are using LiDAR etc.  .   etc.  .   to navigate obstacles
I just feel sorry for all the food delivery robots getting stuck  .   I don't know why, maybe its because they are being helpful and not an asshole like a security bot or something
This is better than calling a Chinese take out who steals your change and or forces you to tip and curses at you if you don’t tip sorry I don’t tip owners
Damn, I was hoping one of the theft deterrents would be electric shock so if you try to steal the robot it shocks the piss out of you and then goes on its way  .  
they’re also locked and can only be opened with the app  .   You won’t be opening up a stolen one unless you break it open, which isn’t necessarily easy  .  
Then one of the cameras will pick up the driver's registration number and they get hit with a big fat fine  .   Hope it was worth it to stop someone getting their groceries
Milton Keynes is an new city that's been well planned  .   No one is going out vandalizing these robots  .   People like the robots and if someone tried to vandalize one people would stop them  .  
No one can pry it open it has strong lock which only opens with users code and if someone even try to pry it open it will start an loud alarm  .   Watch this for to know
I agree they are so cute  .   I just want to give it a big hug, but then I will get little tire tracks on me from the little robot trying to get away from me lol
This is great but surely will only be implemented in rich neighborhoods, hotels, private schools, etc.  .   That’s fine though, it’s one step more to the immediate “future”
We have some here in Northampton (Duston)  .   They are great fun to watch especially crossing the roads  .   We can't help anthropomorphizing them and feeling sorry for them when they can't get across easily  .  
It's awesome that we get to use these during lock down  .   I have been ill for 13 years and i have a suppressed immune system so this really does minimize the risk of me being exposed  .  
These little robot's are so cool I have never seen one either i would help one if it got stuck or needed a little push up a little hill, think the kid's would love this
The robot has 9 cameras, 2-way audio, alarms if you pick it up, tracking to the nearest inch and of course the robot is locked during a delivery  .   Quite an embarrassing thing to get caught doing!
Are you serious??? You are just as bad as the man you two need to go to a mental hospital the robot was just doing its job no need to treat it like trash!!
I absolutely appreciate the idea behind stuff like this, I love technology and love the idea of us taking actual steps into the utopian future we all dreamed about when we watched Back to the Future 2 as kids
Would still be caught you couldn't escape it  .   Then those who do are already that far behind on the technology wouldn't be able to analyze this thing and if they are that advance they wouldn't steal it  .  
I just made my order in my area  .   Wait time is 43 mins  .   The robot supposedly plays music when arrival so yeah  .   We got our robots just last Wednesday  .   My kids are both excited!!
Wow that is so cool  .   Amazing technology we are getting  .   Looks like Irvine is the place to be for these new features like the Amazon store   .   Can't wait for the hoverboards to be built   .  
Sorry Kenny  .   They work well and often right here in West Los Angeles  .   There's also pretty heavy so they are hard to knock over and someone who knocks over someone else's food is an asshole
I deliver for DD and this Starship inspired me to make my own delivery cart It’s not remote control: but I push a 3 wheel cart with delivery bag and drink cooler in one , customers love it
They can deliver groceries but can they go a round in robot wars? Very cool the way they give way to pedestrians and wait to cross the road even if it is against a pedestrian no crossing light  .  
I did  .   They thank you, lol  .   That said if you pester them they actually warn you that they can call the police  .   Saw a couple college kids messing with one until it threatened them with it
If you think about it, people can do the same when they ever come out with self driving uber cars it is easy to be petty if you think we’re stupid to be replaced by your machines
Robot  .   DELIVERY ON ANY college campuses would be a great thing in any college that apply for it in any State as long as it is on  the campus here on the campus chef's cooking there  .  
It only opens when it reaches it destinations  .   You can try to force it open but an alarm will go off and snap a few photos and sends it directly to a local police with the GPS location  .  
They are so cute looking! I think it is a good idea  .   And we need to give people better opportunities and support for better training and better jobs  .   I don't think stopping advancement is the answer  .  
wonderful idea in theory, Hopefully it will have some type of 911 system built in and some form of self defense, or it won't make it one week in the inner cities  .   I love the idea though  .  
I see these on Oakdale  .   So cool! These robots know when to stop and go at intersections and travels down the sidewalks  .   It be a few out there making deliveries  .   How much is the delivery services?
it would be easier getting food yourself then stealing that robot honestly that thing is super hard to open and it has cameras on every angle and as soon as someone else tries to take it  sends a distress signal
The same sales pitch  .   "robots can help people Focus ok other things" Well if you tale delivery jobs away - what jobs would there be - automation does not always create new jobs for those who have low skill sets
That is one polite robot! It is a very cool concept although I feel like it is only helpful right now in areas such as university or office complexes  .   How did the coffee turn out after the delivery?
My sister helps them all of the time and then puts googly eyes on them they are so cute but very dumb like they don't always go when they can do she will sometimes carry them across the road  .  
, I saw a video of someone running over one of these with a car while it was trying to cross the street it even retreated because it got very damaged and the stupid person didn’t even care
Can you imagine when getting stuck? That’s the cutest thing  .   Then he needs his people help her to get him out so he can continue on with a hard days work  .   Godspeed, little dude  .  
There were a lot of times where my delivery guy was late/lazy/a deadbeat gangbanger or stoner and I would rather people like that not deliver my food  .   I am ok with robots replacing those people, this is of course my opinion
Michael Right? These things are pretty much theft-proof, with 360⁰ cameras and location tracking  .   Not to mention the general awkward weight and shape - I would like to see someone try to surreptitiously smuggle one of those under their jacket lol
I have these on my campus  .   They’re actually really cute and take their sweet time making sure it’s safe before crossing intersections  .   Sometimes the crossing guards have to stop the traffic to let them cross
It sends out a signal for assistance  .   and usually the robots are locked so if you try opening it you wont be able to  .   If you pick it up it sounds an alarm like the one you heard falling down
Yes  .   Do you not like getting your food delivered on time? I work in pizza delivery and we are always short staffed  .   We need things like this to help us deliver more food to more people on time  .  
My 4 year old recently got in WALL-E  .   My parents live in the area these boys deliver  .   We ordered a few groceries and he got a kick out of seeing it come by  .   He kept saying Hi WALL-E! Great time!
I this for this to work they need to make this unmanned vehicle rather than fully automatic so that the delivery guy can operate it from home and get paid too  .  this harmonic relationship will benefit both unemployment and ease of work
It seems really smart  .   The AI and cameras on this thing are pretty impressive  .   So yea I don’t think it would get hit by a car  .   But the mean people part  .   yea that’s an issue
They are taking jobs that nobody else wants  .   Nobody wants to work in food service  .   If you still see terrible service after the pandemic ends, you know why  .  People are tired of the bad treatment by management and customers
These things are actually adorable in person Lol, though I might be a bit bias  .   They remind me of numerous family oriented robot movies; "short circuit", "R2D2", "Wall-E" to name a few  .  
Delivery robots are outfitted with multiple cameras  .   A lock and a GPS thar can track them down to the nearest inch  .   No thief will be getting into one, unless they want to be hit with heavy fines or jail time  .  
 I hope I can see one in the future, they are so cute, I can't explain it  .   They got that little flag, ah its too cute  .   I am glad they can threaten others if messed with  .  
I want one so bad it's unreal, I know they are not meant to be kept but they are so  cute! I see them roaming everywhere it's really fun, kind of want to make one myself and paint it
the robot is tracked, it has an alarm if one were to pick it up or try and pry open the lid, and it is locked, only when the user taps a link in a text message will it then open
Ehen I can guarantee you there are still many surprised and amazed people that would stop by and take videos/photos of these little robots even after a couple of years of having them in Mountain View  .   Haven't seen the Walmart cleaning machines!
Scout is a pretty good innovation and a smart response to the COVID restrictions of physical contact  .   Not the happiest to see Amazon discontinue it  .   Hoping Amazon Scout is transformed into something even more helpful in the future  .   Well done guys  .  
I would have loved it if the little robot knew you were following it an sped up or if it up on a little siren and tried to pull you over  .    .   Lol I wonder what the little robot does on his day off  .  
At least help them but there is a lot of those guys and those guys are pretty heavy so you might want to help them out if you can they are supposed to seek compassion too they weren't just made to make tiktok about
Um no it was just trying to get by the least he could of done was not actually kick it it's a robot no wonder they will grow to get machine guns and use them against us because of people like him and you!
As a guy who can barely walk 20 meters nowadays, I would love to use those  .   'Would most likely be cheaper then paying someone to make the grocery runs for me and having more small runs would make me less dependent on long-life foods  .  
nope, it has no problem getting up the sidewalks and stairs, and it's completely sealed until you unlock it with your phone, besides, it has cameras all around it so if anyone tries anything funny they could actually take legal action
They have trackers in them and are worth a good bit of money, I am sure the company takes theft of their assets pretty seriously  .   Wouldn't be long before the police show up at your crack den searching high and low for the thing
I want to assure everyone in the comments that if the inventors are able to come up with this they would absolutely be able to think of a safety system for it and will do it , u think u r smartasses all of u , Jesus
They have security system, 360 degree cameras, picking up sensors, alarms and robots call their HQ where appropriate measure will be taken against perpetrators  .   Also, the robots originate from Estonia, which is colder than Scotland and they drive just fine during snowy wintertime
I hope this doesn't happen to me  .   I would be very sad to lose my dream job like that  .   I would be happy for the robot though!!! Its a great job  .   I have been happy for the last 23years working there  .  
Won't happen because there will be airborne drones loitering on a random observation path and ready to support any ground drone which signals tampering  .   After the first few get very heavily dealt with, no one will risk it for a few bags of shopping  .  
My Daughter lives in MK and her partner saw one struggling up a small kerb, he crossed the road and gave it a helping hand and a little voice said "Thank you" and off it went on its way, how cute is that   .  
However this is an interesting step into the future of robotics taking over basic jobs  .   A driverless car could drive to a customers home and the robot then rolls out of the car and approaches the home  .   That makes sense and completely removes the delivery job
Usually if those things get stuck for a while, whoever is monitoring it will take control and fix it  .   That said, i have come across one of these flipped over in the middle of the sidewalk, calling out for help  .   Weirdest shit that day
 we have many theft prevention measures to stop it happening  .   The robot has 9 cameras, 2-way audio, alarms if you pick it up, tracking to the nearest inch and of course the robot is locked during a delivery  .   Quite an embarrassing thing to get caught doing!
lol okay  .   But you still only provide problems and no solutions  .   The robot can take physical punishment and avoid private property  .   The company can pay the taxes for occupying public space  .   The cameras can capture thefts and prosecute ppl who behave unlawfully  .   Happy now?
they will have air support  .   Think how quickly an unmanned aerial drone can reach a ground robot which puts out a distress call  .   Then you are on HD film and face and gait matched  .   May be some vandalism to begin with but it will soon stop  .  
I actually prefer robots most of the time  .   It's 100 times easier to order food from a kiosk than trying to yell what I want to a dippy kid in a noisy restaurant  .   Automating mundane tasks leaves more humans free to do jobs that actually have meaning  .  
This is the second video I have seen of these things now  .   Great idea for senior citizens who cannot walk far or cannot get out to buy their groceries  .   Cant wait for the Drone delivery bots, I think security won’t be happy everywhere
Hahaha yeah , the robots wait till there isn't no vehicles coming then they cross but our fellow dimwitted humans walk out into the street when there are vehicles going past , it's pretty bad that a robot can make safer decisions than what a people brain does  .  
I don't understand how one minute I am like "we must protect these adorable little dudes at all costs" and feel bad when they get stuck, but then I see him falling down while "screaming" and it's the funniest shit I have seen all day
It's actually the opposite there's not enough regulation  .   Company's are afraid to roll these technologies out because they don't know where their liabilities are  .   Until they know you won't see company's taking the risk of mass release and then getting sued into the ground  .  
I think it is great  .   In terms of just being cool and helping the environment, making cities more livable  .   Education is becoming so accessible that anyone who wants a good job and is capable of putting in the work to learn something can get one  .   - Just my opinion  .  
Funny to see a little vehicle like that out and about all on it’s own, just taking care of business It seems determined to get to where it’s going Maybe you can do an update after a while, to see how it’s been working out  .  
Dashers don't ignore short deliveries, those are ideal for us  .   We avoid long delivery with $3 payouts and $3 payouts in general when the customer isn't tipping the driver  .   This robot exists to delivery to non-tipping customers who live a short distance away  .   The non-tipping customer is why it exists  .  
those robots use a series of onboard cameras that follow the ground in front of the robot and it looks for obstacles that is in it's way and it makes decisions on how to get around it  .   They are programmed to avoid the grass and soil so they don't get stuck  .  
As a lawyer, I will ensure to get you and likewise people arrested every single time I see before you even attempt to vandalize coco drones  .   This kind of initiatives enables disabled people who cannot leave their house job opportunities and you want to kick it you disgusting horrible person!!!
As an Amazon driver I don't care if it will take my job  .   Time to move on, people should start to do more complicated job, robots needs developers and support team  .   So it would be still enough jobs for us, but life would be easy and cool with robots  .  
You order the food you want from an app  .   Starship then charge you a delivery fee  .   It's not a lot but hopefully enough for them to make a profit and continue expanding the service  .   Mundane jobs should be replaced by robots, it's dehumanizing and depressing doing monotonous repetitive work  .  
We have come a long way in autonomous car technology over the past five years  .   You obviously won't get all the way there in five years  .   Your comment is kind of like complaining to NASA that they spent seven years after JFK's moon speech to actually send men to the moon  .  
I would do the same, but I wouldn't be able to save it in time because it would either be A) shot in a drive-by B) ran over due to non intoxicated drivers C) stolen/bot-knapped and possibly jumped now the million dollar question, what country could I be from, hell even add a state
Bro it’s actually sad about the robots is that they are trying to do there job but everyone is trying to stop them they are working day and night and people are trying to stop them it’s not only hard for our lives but also hard for robots thank you for your time
Its a new service to you area it takes time to work out the problems, the decent thing you jackasses should do is help it along instead of criticizing progress  .   And maybe if you got off your fat asses and shopped for yourselves they wouldn't make a box with wheels delivering your shit food  .  
This is still amazing to me  .  :  .  I have never seen these till recently but only in videos  .   people walk by it like it’s part of the natural landscape  .  while I would watch and I am in awe  .   Still amazed at the floor cleaning vacuum machine at Walmart and sams club:
That's just a novelty   .   the domino and Ford self driving cars delivering pizza are on point; they are gonna be just as quick as a driver  .   Well, maybe slightly slower if it were moped  .   but it's only a matter of time till self driving mopeds come along  .   or drones  .  
I liked ALL of the Kiwibots; but, the PRODUCE Robot Van was incredible! Imagine, having "cold" fresh vegetables & fruit coming to your neighborhood on certain days  .   My mother (82 years  .   young) said, that it would be a delight to shop at that Robot Van because it reminded her of the FARMER MARKETS!
it would be risky as these are equipped with gps tracking and tampering detection  .   It would be essentially the same as trying to rob a moving atm  .   You could do it but you will most likely get caught as it automatically contacts the police  .   The reward to risk is not good at all considering all you get is food
YES!!! I saw my first Starship Robot today December 17th 2019 in Milton Keynes  .   I could barely believe my eyes!!! Didn't know what it was, what it was called, took me a few google searches to find out any information about it and this led me to here! Amazing!!!!
I have seen videos of delivery bots delivering  .   It’s a good idea but I’m more looking forward to that with cleaning bots we can recharge them repeatedly councils won’t have the “cost” excuse as it will long term pay for itself and out parks and streets will b so much cleaner  .  
Visited a friend in Espoo, and was mesmerized when I saw one of these little fellas scooting' around  .   After I left, my friend ordered a delivery on one, and had is play "We Built This City" when it arrived, as a silly little joke XD BTW, what's the music used in this video?
Have been successfully using Starship since early 2019 in Milton Keynes, UK’s fastest growing city  .   Starship provide a fabulous app with swift delivery of groceries from two different stores  .   It’s absolutely the way ahead for eco-friendly local deliveries  .   Best of all, it’s here now and now established as part of everyday life  .  
Damn I would love to have something like that in Idaho  .   Will companies like ON semiconductor here in Nampa Idaho  .   since we are growing so fast so quickly when we have all these new electrical and electronic companies coming here I would say about time they start getting stuff like this to us would be a great test ground for it
I agree  .   Everyone's laughing that it's "useless" or there's no point if someone has to go along with it  .   But that's how you develop something  .   We can't go from no robots to fully autonomous, smart, reliable, safe, etc. etc. food delivery robots  .   (explaining a bit for other people)
They have in-built cameras, ultra loud alarms and a GPS system that tracks their location to the nearest inch  .   Good luck trying to steal or damage one  .   Though why would anyone want to anyway? The small amount of groceries that they will be carrying will not be worth the hefty fines or jail time one would receive in return  .  
It's not flat, they can go uphill  .   And the pavements in Milton Keynes are pretty smooth and tend to avoid the roads (by having a bridge over the road or an underpass)  .   As for people messing with them, I have not seen anyone touch them when they shouldn't but apparently they have camera's and an alarm  .  
They are on my college campus now, and they are cutest things  .   They patiently wait at crosswalks, go on about their business, and try their best to stay out of the way  .   The only they’ve been scary is when they detect something that really wasn’t there, correct course, and start driving towards you  .  
you can already do that with humans too  .   its called a robbery both are crimes  .   but with the robot you will be on several camera angles, getting your height, sex, and rid number from your I  .  D in your pocket and your Ip address from your Bluetooth enabled phone in your pocket  .   it wont be the discreet perfect crime you are imagining
1 year ago Some silly people steal cars and bikes, and potentially robots in the future, but we have many theft prevention measures to stop it happening  .   The robot has 9 cameras, 2-way audio, alarms if you pick it up, tracking to the nearest inch and of course the robot is locked during a delivery  .   Quite an embarrassing thing to get caught doing!
I think the delivery robot is better  .   While drone delivery sounds like a nice idea for the suburbs, they have no place in dense cities that don’t have many sidewalks to begin with; and on top of everything they have trees, cables, signs, etc.  .   Furthermore, I’m sure these sidewalk delivery robots are way more energy efficient and can do more deliveries on a single charge  .  
Rough news buddy, these things proved themselves resilient to the chav, and so their thing well  .   Also, people love them, and their friendly design, leaving most people to not desire to harm them  .   There are even people helping these buggers when they are stuck, so likely, they will replace delivery drivers  .   Once their pathfinding and speed improves, good luck  .  
We are already operating commercially in 4 countries and we work very hard to ensure that our robots work seamlessly and share space respectfully alongside other people on the sidewalks  .   If one were to malfunction we have local teams who are able to respond immediately and pick up the robot to ensure it is not causing any blockages or obstruction  .   Thanks!
Someone can steal it but it has a tracking device and as soon as it takes a picture of you it will track you and match the picture of your face with your Driver's license health card student ID and much more Know where you live and send that information to authorities But only the ones that came out 3 months ago that have that capability and mechanism the new C3S Model
I just think it's funny how someone had to remote control the bot, to make it come to the host (like, throughout the show) :D Ahh it's cool to see fellow Estonians make something cool happen  .   From the first stages of the robots being controlled on sidewalks, when they were a new thing, to what they have become now, over the pond  .  
Well of course you can but why would you? You would be on cameras, it's fricking hard to break it open and when you are done, the surprise meal inside is probably already cold - if it even was warm in the first place  .   It wouldn't really be worth it since you most likely would get sued for the damage on the robot and the stolen meal  .  
It is not such a bad thing to have delivery robots, in a liberal economy there will be sure less job opportunities for deliverymen position at the other hand since there will be more food companies who will want to use them rivalry and everything will get higher so food prices will get lower for us  .   one of the reasons why you got to think more on your career choice  .  
This makes life easier for those who are blind, deaf, or have other disabilities that prevent them from accomplishing simple tasks for people like us, like getting groceries  .   Sure, that's probably not what the founders had in mind because they care about money, but technology like this and autonomous vehicles will help a huge population subset that is often overlooked like the disabled, kids, and elderly  .  
I saw one of these earlier today  .   They are quite cute! In regards to someone stealing them, they have GPS accurate to an inch, they have a loud siren if you try and lift them and they have loads of cameras filming everything  .  so even is someone did manage to steal one, they would lead the police right back to their lair  .  for 2 bags of groceries or a takeaway pizza!
I get my pizzas delivered by drone all the time! I must say I had this same excitement and enthusiasm you showed for this delivery bot when we first got an automatic washing machine in 1975! 'Look OMG it's filling with water ' 'Oh it's spinning!' 'Oh wow it's putting washing powder in now!' 'I can't believe it's making bubbles and washing our clothes on it's own!!' ️
It's of course using AI like computer vision in order to drive around, recognize objects and people and try to avoid them  .   Therefore it can also detect of it's stuck with the help of said computer vision and GPS  .   What got me wondering was when it turned towards him what got my brain rattling for a minute but I guess it just tracked him through the cameras since it has nearly 360° vision  .  
Although this technology will one day eliminate my job  .  it’s totally awesome  .  endless possibilities for what you could do with this  .   the scary thing is this could be used in other industries to eliminate the need for a person to work and eliminate thousands of jobs  .  but it’s still “mind blowing” that somebody knows how to invent this  .  I’ve never seen anything like it in my life  .  
There is a 360 degrees camera that’s set around the robot and it records everything pretty sure it has also a memory for saving footages for from where it went through and where it’s currently going  .   I’ve watched some documentaries about this thing and the security is just genius  .   Plus you’ll never gonna open if you are not the actual customer because it requires a code for a designated order  .  
Cool stuff  .   The argument that they are taking jobs away is absurd  .   Remember how it was said that robots will take factory jobs? Yet, we still have factory jobs 150 years later  .   You can't stop automation  .   The save money argument is true but who doesn't like saving money and if Starbucks treats its workers poorly, a robot eliminates that  .   So cool stuff Chris and you know of any other cool tech that you can show?
I have to say it's a great idea to some extent, it's just something new, and with that, their are always potholes to over come  .   At first, I thought Emily was gonna praise the Robot for all the wonderful deliveries it has made to her, not keep her captive  .   I think calling a Robot dumb, as many kept saying is a little odd, considering it's not making it's own choices  .  
I think tech like this could be really useful for disabled persons and the elderly to get their groceries or other things delivered  .   Perhaps they could even find use in elderly homes to free up staff to attend to more pressing matters  .   I also could imagine these robots being put to use during non-peak traffic times when sidewalks are less busy as well  .   equipped As long as it doesn't take away from people's side hustles, I am all in!
They are at Bowling Green State now, and my sister and I have been following them around campus  .   The newspaper said there’s 30 of them which will operate from 7:30 AM to 1 PM and take care of 500 orders a day  .   They look both ways and wait patiently before crossing the road, they have a flag that can light up to signal that they’re there  .   I feel like the future is within our grasp, WE CAN DO THIS
And it has multiple cameras, probably microphones, as well as multiple GPS sensors  .   I’m sure the lid is not easily pried open and that it can be remotely disabled  .   So even if you did steal it and manage to access the food, you are probably gonna be easily found by the police and charged with a felony since this robot certainly exceeds the $500 threshold or whatever it may be in your area for theft to count as a felony  .  
This is for businesses, not for sending your friend PlayStation games  .   Lets say that you own a pizza restaurant in center of the town  .   You will have lots of orders in 5km circle  .   You will have 10 orders per one hour  .   This means that one person, with scooter, can deliver like 5 pizzas  .   So you should have at least 2 workers  .   Lets say that you will buy 5 robots  .   so one day it is more profitable than keeping Employees  .   That's the point!
Sadly cognitive systems are being taught advanced learning skills, engineering and programing, the code these systems will write and possibly create will surpass what any people can achieve, the people heading these advances are not excluding any people skill set from becoming just another thing these Ai systems will master beyond our ability to even compete with  .   At least humanity will be proud to still do some things better than machines, create scarcity, poverty, cruelty, pain and suffering and be unnecessarily greedy  .  
FedEx and Amazon was the best but I feel for this system to work  .   We need to change some local criminal laws  .   If you are prosecuted for anything above a felony involving theft or more that you would receive not only a jail sentence but a ticket to relocate to another town to keep the city safe for like-minded peaceful law bidding citizens so these delivery units will be safe and undisturbed  .   That might sound extreme but do you have a better idea  .   I can't see these bots rolling through Ghetto land  .  
Great point but, as far as I know, at night they get stored inside a shop  .   In Mountain View they used to be parked by Ava's Market and, just before the shop closing time, they would enter the store and be locked in  .   Probably to recharge as well  .   So I guess you are right, they probably can't operate at night  .   At the same time they have plenty of cameras and a GPS so  .   Pretty sure lifting them would active an alarm and capture and locate/track the thief  .  
I can see your perspective in your comment and I would like to add the pros that Coco robots have One it’s better for the environment Two it’s a work from home job- meaning no transportation costs Three delivery tips mostly go towards gas and car maintenance, and car depreciation value  .   No car depreciation value in this job  .   Four this is a great job for people who are wheelchair bound, have an autoimmune disease, cancer, or any other condition that would require you to stay home  .   Five it also delivers food faster
The Way The Average American lives life is not gonna last much longer  .   Good thing more intentional communities are popping up, because it will be a lot better, if more people grew their own food and made their own clothes  .   I believe it's gonna happen, because there's Tiny House Villages that are housing more and more homeless people, but there's still a long way to go, but it's a process though  .   I believe that those Tiny House Villages will end up growing giant gardens, so there will be more food  .  
The robots deliver groceries and food as well, for only $2 delivery fee, and no you can't tip them  .   You can pay using your Pitt dining plan as well  .   I imagine they can be very useful to the community with disabilities  .   Sure, they aren't perfect, but nothing is  .   This would have been unthinkable 5 years ago  .   And do you see how far back out of the way they are at crossings, even in your own video? Hard to believe they block anything  .   It's easy to complain, but is it actually justified?
My cousin did that once hour later The cops were knocking on his door It took exactly 175 pictures of my cousin's face in less than a minute It instantly matched The picture of my cousin's face with his license health card and student ID Then the cops did the rest of the work to find out where he lives So I warn you probably best not to F with these little robots There more smarter than you think I am telling you they have the capability to make decisions of their own Which makes me think that Elon musk theory is true that AI will take over
My local grocery store just got these "Starships" in on Wednesday  .   I haven't personally used them, but I didn't see one in route until late yesterday  .   Super cute!! I want one as a pet though  .   Your very own RDD2, I mean Starship  .   lol My husband talked with one of the girls (cashier) he knows and IF one attempts to steal one the robot CAN call the local police (has a direct line to them) and IF one attempts to grab one it will make a loud siren noise  .   Just let them be and do their jobs  .  
Hi Damien Specter, we have never had one stolen - they have a number of anti-theft measures including a locked cargo hold (only the customer can unlock it using their smartphone), cameras, sirens, and GPS tracking  .   They are constantly supervised remotely by our staff in a control center  .   As they have travelled hundreds of thousands of miles across many different cities they have experienced a few minor bumps and scrapes along the way but have never been in a serious accident with a third party  .   Surprisingly most of the people who encounter them actually ignore them, the ones who interact are usually very excited and intrigued  .   Thanks!
But it's not useless  .   How do you still not get that? As I mentioned earlier  .   The point of the robot is NOT to deliver food, but learn how they can make the tech better  .   The only way to do that is to put it out on the street and collect data  .   Yes, it needs a chaperone as of now because it's the most effective way to gather said data, but that doesn't make it useless  .   It makes it less profitable to employ as a food delivery system, but makes perfect sense for developing the tech  .   Again, how the hell do you not understand that it is useful for something else than you think it's for?
They could implement Tasers or something like that  .   Also I think there's loud alarm when it's picked up (or will be in future versions), you would get a lot of attention, and there's loudspeaker now  .   And of course cameras, GPS, and you can't open it without code easily  .   It's too much trouble really to deal with it especially if there's a chance they capture your face  .   And it's questionable how profitable it would be selling parts, there are many ways to make it too much trouble  .   Selling custom parts unofficially could be illegal, who would buy these parts? People who need these robots will not buy from someone shady if they don't want to encourage stealing  .  
I live in Cambourne and I can't express how much of a difference these will make to life  .  I have autism and add, and anxiety is crippling to the point that my legs seize up when I try and walk  .   (weird I know lol)  .   They were launched here yesterday, and I ordered yesterday and tonight lol (it will take a while for me to get over the novelty aspect)  .   I have 5 of those little Anki (now dreamlabs) robots because I love them and they are so cute  .    .   now we have these cute little robots pottering around I have got some sticky googly eyes here somewhere, and I will have to refrain from sticking them on one of the robots (Don't worry, I don't do it lol) I think they will make a big difference for so many people who are unable to "pop to the shop" for a variety of reasons  .   you don't realize to what extent (or maybe you do lol)  .   this is a massive weight off my shoulders personally, so thank you!
I liked Starship Tech's best  .   The only company thoughtful enough to alert pedestrians in heavily walked, and crowded intersections using a well placed flag  .   Whether or not we like it, we humans are somewhat like deers, who work best in a flat environment, and who tend to ignore "anomalies," that don't fit into our "flat space," especially when "maxed out" as in walking through a crowd in a heavily walked intersection  .   Just like the deer who is easily picked off by hunters in tree-stands, so to will pedestrians often stumble over a rolling beer cooler trying to navigate itself through a heavily walked intersection, with no eye-height flag  .   Which ever company is found to be best at meeting such people needs, will be found to be the most "needed" company  .   I agree with the Starship engineers, that attempts to fly merchandise overhead using the whirring blades of drones, totally ignores the very people need for safety from such overhead accidents waiting to happen  .   Sensible robots that are conscientiously designed with people safety first will take the day  .

in the Bay Area, Palo Alto
I was wondering the same thing  .  
Maybe have one deliver you money?
They need snow tires on those!
It looks like a tiny delivery truck
It's the robot who's guilty
I had right away the same question
The a  .  i uprising will not spare you
LOL Where's My Food?!
This also happens at George Mason University
I saw this on Sssniperwolf's channel
U know George mason does this too
they have these things in Toronto too
Who puts oil on tires??
How does it cross the road ?
Folks is this trial still running  .  
These robots don't even have sentience
Will people still deliver as well?

They are nearby in Bedford too!
Truck? They leave from stores   .  
They been in m  .  k for some time
What did the robot even say?
this would do great in Japan  .  
How far did the robot go?
I'm not stopping for your groceries  .  
The future is now, Old man
And if you are not home?
it will deliver the girls one time

These reporters seem freakishly excited about this  .  
Why is it called "Kiwi"?
I see these all the time in Berkeley
A people IS DRIVING IT!!!
How many of these are out there?
How long did they follow coco for?
They disinfect the robot after every deliver  .  
Would move to Estonia for you guys  .  
Oh no the little robot cross the street
You refer the robot "him"?
Why was this suddenly recommended to me?

Where do sign up to be a controller
And I thought they really drive themselves lol
Nah just a 5 dollar delivery fee no thanks
He should put the dog on a leash
damn, robots are now delivering food  .  
Just saw like 20 in a college in Massachusetts
Do I still have to tip the driver
Where are those drones Amazon promised us?
what if I just sit on it?
Does this robot counts as a drone?
Can’t even watch Wall-E in Ohio
Same on my council estate in the 🇬🇧
You would ride one wouldn't you?
Why would you do that authorities alerted?
Looks like it’s made of cardboard
Needs tank treads for winter! So cool
Where can I see to make this ?
This is a sign for the robot uprising
So now robots have the right of away
So now robots have the right of away
Developed in Estonia, nearly same climate  .  
is this Castro str in mountain view?
Well he’s not getting a tip
I don't know why this made me laugh
Oh the robots go to your campus?
Do food delivery robots have 1st amendment rights?
The best one still has to be designed
does it work with kids and school runs?
Fed ex it looks like it moves faster
My area might get them next decade  .  
Same could be said about delivery drones  .  
I think it will depend on the demand
robot are the version of drunk ai lol
what is the name of the robot?
wow even robots are using plastic bags  .  
Today is when you need that bicycle!

And what if it is raining outside?
It is like a clone of Starship robots
Here in the UK we have people delivery
part of an integrated autonomous military supply system
And so far are they working well?
There's a black mirror episode like that
Nope, not like that robot at all
Its like u want to thank the robot
We are turning into the movie WALL-E
This is nothing like the Terminator movies!
How much would the delivery fee be?
Wait, who the heck controls it?
The Red Flag Says "JUST EAT"
wait how did it get up the stairs?
Can it cross the street with walk signs?
What if there are stairs to the door?
Have you ever heard of home delivery?

it weighs too much to push that robot
it has motion sensor cameras on it
Will it work in Canada’s winter ?
It looks all white  .  Sinclair could go back into business
It's like a dog off it's lead
Do robots now how much is it cost to
The starships can be all around the world?
I think they need a little more bigger wheels
It looks like a person is operating it  .  
So the company has made 1 million dollars then?
Do you have these robots in UK colleges?
Just saw 2 of them today, in plano Texas
Who orders non sealed liquid in one of these
head Liquid can be stored in a bag  .  
Where do the Clone Troopers come out of?
What does it do when it encounters stairs ?
Build a tougher robot to handle the terrain  .  
I know, but these companies are strict dude
What will make you think it will attack?
this is why we can't have nice things
He just killed the bogyman to that dog  .  
how long will it take to deliver it?
Does it know to stop at ref lights?
What street is this recorded on? Thanks!
Did you give "him" a tip?
it drives itself, it’s a robot
There is actually someone piloting that via remote control
In Charlotte they are pink too with heart eyes
This gonna work better in countries like Japan
Many companies have been doing this 4-5 years now  .  
Hasn't Ethiopia been doing this for years already?
wait they’re in San Jose too?
I have seen these little guys yesterday by DQ
They will spare you when the war comes  .  
Lazy people gonna convenience themselves into uselessness  .  
Retable scooters isn't really a success story  .  
Well that takes Uber Eats out of the equation
Those have been around for a good while now
my brother sent me a video of that today
They also have them in Milton Keynes, England
HEY that first started in NAU Northern Arizona University
I just leaned that in school Starship made it
Your case gone cold while his food served hot
What we would need is a weaponized version  .  
I still don't understand how this is profitable  .   
I don't think they are compulsory yet  .  
U could say that about any place though  .  
you should try it at some point though  .  
That FedEx Bot look like an R2-D2 prototype  .  
More eco-friendly than a guy on a bike?
How to fix a robot 101 Just add thank you
What do you think about having delivery robots?
Japan would be a place this might work  .  
That would create too much noise pollution Imo  .  
What would stop people destroying them on purpose ?
What’s the price difference for this?
 I had no clue about this new thing  .  
This is the strangest dream I have ever had
I seen one rescue another one at kents hill
I live in higham Ferrers and coop got them
they have been there 6years mad in it
Been using these in Scotland for over 20 years  .  
That is the most I've ever seen of it
nothing is green I should have said greener  .  
Makes you wonder how long it was waiting  .  
Could the operator get a j walking ticket?
First time seeing this guy's blows my mind
No doubt has a tracker and camera on it
It needs an arm to push those buttons itself
Probably a call center from India is controlling it
does one stop and goes back to warehouse ‍️
The whole drone will go missing in the hood
What if it needs to cross the street?
In India it will launch what happens??
Reminds me of the mouse droids from star wars
Wow so our assuming it’s gender ️‍
How much cost in this Robotic service system all
Do robot food delivery get tip from customers?
in the future, these delivery robots may fly
Are masks mandatory for autonomous food delivery? Bahahaha
it’s not locked inside a robot though
or just walk like 3 blocks to get your food
it's lock until it arrives at the house
He is the food robot meatballs!!!
Black Light that’s not how it works
Let's see how it deals with Indian traffic
Is it free delivery and no mark up?
These have been in saw tell for a few years
You don't think nothing weird of it?
i live in Northampton and these things are everywhere
Do you have any chance of coming to Brazil?
Why would you even think of someone doing that?
Did the robot try to do a hit and run
I think it was name after the kiwi bird  .  
It must be such a pain navigating Houston sidewalks  .  
Next video of one on blocks with the wheels stolen
Nope  .   Get up and get your own food  .  
Rumor has it that he is still suck there today
Cool they should of gave it legs and arms  .  
I think just engineering a better interior would solve this
2016 came and went haven't seen one yet in my town
They remind me of mouse droids from Star Wars!
Only if they redesign it to look like R2D2  .  
They should put a little happy face on it  .   
These have been a thing for months in London  .  
where did my tip go? Robot allowance? Lol
California is actually where similar robots are already being used
Needs a snowplow in the updated design or tank treads
the company should try tracks (the ones military tank have)
we are in the same area saw 2 today in Timperley
not with the smart surveillance
Put electric shock warning ️ on the delivery bot  .  
I hope they do that to the self-drive cars too
Notice how he thought it was opened from the front 1:13
Sorry guys, got to make this quick delivery!
IF YOU DIDNT SEE IT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT
Plot twist the criminal called for gun cigarettes and pizza
He is just exercising his constitutional freedom of movement  .  
Much needed pizza and beer for the bank robbers  .  
not AI those are controlled by a person remotely  .  
We have these all over Ku lmao Seen them everyday
Us Berkeley has had these for over 2 years now lol
Bro, pizzas here ! Go pay the robot  .  
Amazon and FedEx have also rolled out their delivery robot
'like a lock'? So what is it then?
The FedEx bot turned that corner like a BOSS  .  
Yeah we can all learn some coding and stop complaining
What stops people from destroying ride-sharing vehicles on purpose?
This reminds me of the movie iRobot for some reason
Not yet getting there still a ways to go  .  
Yes I have seen these and yes they do work
This as been going on in MK for over 3 years
These things are all over the place in MK  .  
It’s been done for years around Milton Keynes
We have had them for about 4 or 5 years in MK
Did it have a clearly displayed operator I  .  D  .  ?
Yip it would have no chance here in Glasgow  .  
so should be using a diesel truck to deliver?
somehow I think the roll-out in Liverpool might be delayed
This robot star only half mile away from me  .  
The robot' overlords will reward your kindness after the takeover
Maybe his beeping was his way of saying thanks  .  
There’s actually a people driving the little machine
I don’t think it can swim fella  .  
This is good, but can you outrun it?
They need to consider equipping it with a taser  .  
And i have never used Amazon in my life  .  
I believe I saw this at James Madison University  .  
Bet it cost enough money to provide thousands of meals
What happens when just anybody come to get the food
wat if i push the robot over while its delivery
Is food hot when you receive it ???
The robot is surrounded by camera so it will stopped
Because the Liberals are working hard for their own food  .  
The robot later claimed whip lash and got lovely pay out
And the robot just keeps going like if nothing ever happened
I have heard of stores that has cleaning and sort robots
They will be robbed and vandalized the first day in Houston
How did you know it was on its way home?
Maybe Lucky's should consider changing the wheels every winter  .  
saw it over a week ago on a different channel  .  
Hahahahaha! "Concerns about theft" Not in Japan  .  
I am retired now but I am trained to repair them
That's gonna be hard to clean I assume  .  
We’re missing the best part  .   The actual deliver…
- PUBG Mobile The person will pay his medical bill himself XD
yeah but can it press a level in a lift ?
I would ride it and see where it gets me to
You are supposed to go outside to meet the delivery robot  .  
its way too heavy to be stolen by one person lol
They should fit them with superbike engines possibly Ninja or R1
Is someone controlling it or is it going by itself?
it's an artificial intelligence he can take action by himself
Yes it’s controlled by Hector Pablo at post mates headquarters
They are MONITORED by humans, but otherwise they are autonomous
Apparently, it can play music when at your door  .  
Is someone controlling it like you would on a drone?
He's an idiot No one controls them it's autonomous
I have seen the Starship robots at George Mason University  .  
“ *Excuse me, I have food to deliver  .  * “
Robot: excuse stormtroopers but lord Vader requested his dinner  .  
We will see how good they are when it snows  .  
You don't have Postmates delivery robot? Massive miss!
Yeah Fed ex bot looks to be the best one  .  
these robots should have blue lights that scare the crime also
Do a lot of cars fall over where you live?
How will it escape criminals and those with malevolent intentions?
Interesting! What robots do you have in your area?
Saw these robots in Judge Dredd  .   The Stallone version  .  
Maybe it calls an automated robot squad like in Robocop :)
I have not ordered anything to use the robot yet
Make the perfect coffee table  .   Do they also vacuum?
Was curious about these, thanks for the awesome video!
I wonder how the little robot would run on freeways  .  
Aren't they driven by poorly paid workers from overseas?
guarded by armed drones is the very near future  .  ?
Very old news, they have been driving around for years
I wasn't aware that this stuff existed until now  .  
I wonder how long it sat there waiting for you?
How's he gonna knock or ring the ding dong?
Starship seems to have a much better functioning delivery robot  .  
There’s 40 of these everyday around the Arizona St campus
He will be stronger by the time he reaches your city
Can it deliver my gold plated bathplug????
Just saw a few of these little guys working lol  .  
How do they handle streets with cars and stairs though?
i came here because i saw this video on tiktok
I seen this by unci in California almost stopped to investigate
Robots Future prediction - Robots VS Humanity  .   Any future predictions?
do they take the tips from the robot as well?
The future is underwhelming  .   Where's my flying car?
the robot wouldn't leave unless you tip him
How do I tip that robot for job well done?
so can a car! if its not autonomous its pointless
Mountain View has had them for a couple of years  .  
What happens when someone kicks the robot on its side?
What about robbery? How to robots escape from them?
I wonder if Canada would consider this service anytime soon  .  
this is the UK and they haven’t been trashed
How does it determine it is safe to cross the road?
Lover Coaster Fan Shame  .   Driving without due care and attention  .  
You know what would be better then robots  .   Not being lazy
Where do they sit in the Jan 2022 Highway Code priority hierarchy?
Thank you for the info! Any little helps I guess  .  
Just saw one today 05/21/22 at the intersection of Emancipation and Elgin  .  
Idk if this is plausible in a largely "urban" community
I think they will need to be more ruggedly built to be honest  .  
I took a tour on JMU, they had these as well
So does the bot have like a gun to protect itself?
actually it is not heavy, it is light design  .  
they better not have the “tip driver” thing added lmao
I have never seen these before until last week !!!
If I see one stuck on something should I help it?
it turns on its own and can reach 45 mph faster than human
Can't you do the same with motorbikes or even cars?
a drone can be used in winter when there is snow  .  
When you realize that robot has got further in life than you
which the cart bots or drones? Oh never mind your traditional  .  
oh I just don’t go where they are very often
The speed pickup once it got in the cross walk was cool
I guess the only meal they don't deliver is pizza ?
does anyone remember RALF? I think of him seeing these robots
We just got them in our town  .   I ordered beer  .  
I don't know why I laughed so hard at this  .  
Our corporate masters can't replace us with machines fast enough  .  
how are these better than a delivery driver i don't get it
your place has to be safe that how Milton Keynes got it, Otherwise the robots would be stolen
It is so trippy when you see one of these lol
Fed and amazon for me when it coming to the you  .  K  .  
What happens if they roll over, is it Game Over?
How fitting to have a text-to-speech program read out the texts!
It is currently in developments  .   I will keep you adapted  .  
I would love to see what plans they have on that!
How many sub stations will it take to implement this system  .  
it's because we humans have emotions even though these are bots
The one falling down the stairs whilst screaming an alarm is hilarious
Just put studded tires on them and it will work fine  .  
Does this robot call the police if it's being assaulted?
 Nice to see that from someone in the comments especially now  .  
must take along time for one of those to get to America
Does it just run around with one box at a time?
So, you nicked the Starship robot and painted it blue ?
In Northampton UK they deliver around the area for the local supermarket
So what's stopping someone from breaking it and stealing the food instead
railroads helping society since the 1800s, keep up the good work  .  
I only put money inside the robot if he looks clean  .  
Sorry, but how is it able to cross the street?
In speed, probably; in energy, not at all  .  
When they say college, they mean University of Wisconsin-Madison right?
Do they pay a tax to operate on my public roads?
where are the starships based? i could watch these all day
Technologies Outstanding  .   You have a very innovative and pioneering product here  .  
This should be called "Driver reverses into cycle lane without looking"
They using these things to deliver stock to the stores now too?
There should be subsurface recharging pads when they wait for new orders  .  
Why would you run in front of it like the little girl did
That's great Allen! How long have these robots been around?
John Doe these things will evolve soon an be faster for gad sake
Cool because i know well normal deliverymen cant do their job correctly!
Careful Company most likely have cameras too , watching their investment Just saying
Nothing more important than destroying a 50  .  000U$ robot because your unleashed/untrained dog is afraid <3
100%  of each robot coming back "home" after each delivery trips  .  
I thought it would’ve said goodbye too before it trundled away
We have these on campus across America that deliver food to college students
They aren’t very speedy, good for less than 1 mile trips
It can sense stuff but someone could just barrel through it also though
It’s driven by a real person not a programmed computer  .  
Similar thing near me  .   The number of them varies between 5 and 11  .  
i live in a little town in Northampton and these things are everywhere
One simple google search will show you that it is all automated  .  
You can drive robots in mars  .   But un earth technology isn't enough
 yeah, unfortunately they seem to have disappeared from Mountain View too  .  
Now he needs to navigate and go up stairs to their doors now
Didn’t they make a video about the same robot years ago
how is he late if he sees it everywhere and just asked why
They have had these at Northern Arizona University for the last year  .  
Imagine just ordering food and then you just see that coming towards you
I don't think college students will have the time to do that
The food delivery robot got to do what it's supposed to do
That could be dangerous if that food wasn't for the police officer
They stop dead if I go anywhere near them while out running  .  
Or how they navigate around the long Ques outside the dole office   .  
Autonomous delivery via open ground should be used as a backup route  .  
There will be plenty of robot maintenance, repair and replacement jobs  .  
I wonder how much does each of those robots cost to make  .  
Oh, wow! Here in Finland haven't seen them yet  .  
You didn't tip the robot  .   It probably hates you now  .  
they make it look like there doing good to push things through   .  
Do these robots dance as well like the so called over run nurses  .  
The robot in "flight of the navigator" springs to mind  .  
Yeah  .   Let's see how long that's gonna last  .  
Probably has a tracker on it so the company know where it is
There’s a robot cleaner at my local Tesco  .   Weird  .  
so it's a person sitting at a desk driving that thing?
I want to see how far this robot will come in the Ghetto
Remember, only pick out your box, not the neighbors package  .  
These are all over ASU! I see like 3-4 of these every day
I don't know if this is a good or bad thing  .  
In Australia, you will find them at your local cash converters  .  
I guess trains are the only weapons we have incase of AI takeover
What if the door dash robot needed to go up/down some stairs?
Make a fucking delivery drone  .   Way more faster and no traffic  .  
It should be all over the country, not just in Milton Keynes
Oh come on, at least give it a pat on the roof!
You can get a sledge hammer through there and put its cameras out  .  
Excuse me I am curios, What is the resolution of the cameras ?
There is a people driving that thing  .  it's not fully autonomous  .  
Nothing stops Coco  .   Coco runs just a little too fast for us  .  
My question how good are these delivery robots and are these fast enough?
Would love to see what would happen if the hood had this lol  .  
Where are these things? Cause I’ve never seen them before  .  
How times have changed from the Co op delivery on a push bike  .  
Theirs a 5 mph speed limit on most of these bots in US right now
since the industrial revolution, machines take peoples jobs and creating new jobs!
you can pinpoint its location for the police  .   That should do it  .  
Are you sure? Is it already the version that has an alarm?
Cannot it moves faster than people and turns it has its own navigation
Yes and no, they are monitored by people but mostly move automatically  .  
If the robot got stuck why is there no wheel prints in the snow
"*sniff* I will remember this act of kindness when Skynet goes live"
Humans have more concern for little robots, than they do each other  .  
So these are what shell walkers came from in horizon zero dawn??
They should put like spikes on top of it or something that's not comfortable
I’ve being saying why not just fit super bike engines on them
It actually calls out for help or a people says it via mic?
i want one with a seat and a gps TAKE ME AWAY ROBO BOY
it can be controlled remotely at the command center if it gets stuck  .  
I had one of these in the 1980s, it was called Big Trak  .   
Not really  .   The shop staff still need to put the shopping in there
Preparing these students to face the world of automation when they get out  .  
This is the only job R2D2 could get now that Star Wars is ending
I saw one in Milton Keynes today  .   I wondered what it was  .  
how do i get the kiwi app? i have a Samsung Galaxy J7
why does Starships' drone look like Amazon Prime, who copied who there  .  
What about an old fashion currier service? Do they no longer exist?
Price would likely be a big challenge, those lidars aren’t cheap
Who cares about roads, sidewalk space is much more scarce and precious  .  
Now if only they could sing on a web line and deliver pizzas  .  
If drones deliver groceries will everyone who owns land nearby call the cops?
What if it goes all the way there and you are in the pub ?
nice catch! I have heard it was coming but never seen it till now
What's stopping someone picking it up and running of with it??
These are used on the University of Idaho (US) campus for food deliveries  .  
Worked in MK and seen many of them, even one broken down lol
It would have went anyway once the street light cycled  .   Big whoop  .  
I am surprised we don't have patrol bots yet, Coming soon  .  
Does it have to travel miles at that speed, for one package?
I guess the desperate housewives of Wisteria Lane need their robot parcels delivered too
Reminds me of the sanitation poop picker per robot on the new Netflix series MANIAC
They should make these blowup if someone tries to steal the package inside  .  
I wonder when it's my turn to witness these little guys roaming around
That is actually Estonian technology as made by Starship Technologies based in Estonia  .  
starship technologies  .    .   I wonder what they will make next, 'hint' 'hint'  .  
I don't understand why people don't just turn them on their side
Fuck I need less people interaction  .   When does this come to Canada?
I am sure no people will steal them or vandalize them for kicks  .  
only because u didn't see happening, not means it cant happen  .  
What's stopping the liberals from stealing the food before it gets to my door?
thing is you can run them over and they won't duff you up  .  
None hit by cars yet  .   What happens when a motorcycle rider hits one?
Good job everyone that begs for a higher minimum wage this is your replacement  .  
I wonder where Coco's driver is in Santa Monica?
They are not little  .   They are the size of one of those heavy TVs
I wanted to see him the robot work through that wet driveway  .   Very cool
Don't say hi to a machine, your confused it's not living  .  
Haven't heard much but I guess they have an obnoxious alarm on them Lol
I would love to see these things be the size of normal shopping carts  .  
can it like go into a lift? would it lose signal once inside?
dude I just saw this thing today! I didn't know what it was
This robot does delivery without people's help? from a to b point?
I guaranteed you there will be signs that say "help the robots" lol
How can you trust a robot not knowing what it may be carrying  .  ?
I am upset they don't have name tags with unique names for themselves  .  
How about NOT tipping??? You are already paying for the delivery  .  
Can you imagine delivering gourmet food in the middle of a virus lock down?
These have been in the UK for years in the town of Milton Keynes  .  
I wonder if a robot at In N Out can deliver my double double too
I THINK THE ROBOTS SHOULD PLAY ON BUSY STREETS____ LUDACRIS___MOVE BITCH GET OUT DA WAY
Let's hope they learn quickly that these robots are equipped with safety features  .  
so its for the lazy sods who can't walk to the store then  .  
I would asume the cover does not unlock before the destination has been reached  .  
I see one of these in the US about 3 years ago, clever little things
I Wonder how long it was sitting There waiting for someone to push the button then it can cross the street
They are tracked, so I doubt they would stay that way for long  .  
Vandalism and theft guarantee  .   Probably just start off with very wealthy neighborhood first  .  
Finally I can Order my porn without the delivery guy looking at me funny  .  
robot for lazy people! go to the shops and get your own gear  .  
How can the contents be trusted that no one tampered with it on the way
They usually do, just like we will speed up Uber eats and Grub Hub orders
It would be fun to watch it navigate a maze to make the delivery  .  
Wait till people start taking these out  .   It may be to hard to resist
It needs an inbuilt electric ️shocker for anyone who doesn't have the customers code
Is the robot intentionally designed to look like a toilet when it opens up?
make him deliver food in Compton and see how long would that robot last lol
even if there is an elevator how's it gonna push the button?
wouldn't a drone be way more efficient? If the software works well  .  
Bet Japan will have this in no time of not already  .   New York too
Easy, watch where the heck going ,could have been a kid on a tricycle
They didn't even check to see if it wasn't dangerous inside? :P
Why is this funny  .   The coco had a wreck after hit and run  .   Lol
your fingerprint on its body will be recognized as an attempt to steal things from it
Now they probably still put a tip on the bill for battery charging or something  .  
I wonder if I can buy a delivery robot and have it deliver itself  .  ?
LOL wait until you come to Canada, our deliveries are still hand held no robots
This will be the thing that makes city planners fix wheel chair ramps and pedestrian lanes
If a robot can take your job then you got some other issues to work on
Presumably their driving slow for the camera or to not run down anyone with a box
its has gps tracking to the nearest inch  .   and its locked so no point  .  
plot twist  .   they are actually being manually ran from a call center in India  .  
you must live in a different l  .  a because I never see robots rolling down my street
It would have trackers on it, and it’s probably super heavy, anyway
completely automated? With sensors and stuff? No one remotely controlling it from somewhere?
Yeah, I don't know if those little robots would work in the US  .  
How many people have tried to ride on them and how many get pushed over?
You are gonna need to arm it with some weapons to fend off against rioters
wait you actually think cops don't look where they step in a crime scene?
I wonder how long it will be until delivery robots are used here in Sweden  .  
Artificial intelligence is not gonna replace Humans & the one reason is, bad weather  .  
They are 400lb it's gonna take more than one person to roll that thing over
I like the Fed ex bot is cool why should ups and USPS should have bots
Are people not just hitching a ride on these things? Never seen them in Scotland
Nice adult toys to play on road Are they made in China or up??
I wonder how long it will take for us to have them in New Zealand ?
At least your food will be microwaved with all the radio waves needed to guide this
is it? They testing them down there? Not seen them in the West Midlands
I wonder what's the anti-theft device here? Are they too heavy to steal?
How do they stop people from stealing that shit they must have some system in place
Is that automated or is there someone saying this while watching from a monitor screen?
This is mainly intended and designed for newly established and safer cities like Irvine, CA
lol yeah, because it can only deliver to rich white neighborhoods without getting stolen  .  
if it works on geofencing what if your phone is dead what is gonna happen
First question, can it deliver beer? Go ahead, take my money now!
I'm thinking that it detected getting stuck and a starship employee started remote controlling it  .  
I actually work w door dash and this is the first i have heard of this lol
Put a chain on that thing and this robot can take over Uber as well  .  
Girlscots than can use robots to deliver cookie that could mean more ways to sell cookies
Don’t count on it being a drone. that’s not economically feasible  .  
Yup, we need an army of them  .   In every major city of this country
But it is already doing real world deliveries, at least here in its home country  .  
they hide behind skips when anyone who looks like a ships captain or a tomato approaches  .  
Keeps going with one wheel missing   .   Hopefully the Tesla Bot won’t do this!
Those things are driven by people in Latin America, it's a person not a robot
Yeah if you don't you will be the first to go during the robot uprising  .  
Because if its in a dangerous neighborhood it wont be a person being found under a bridge
I'm not gonna destroy it  .   Just turn it on it's side a little  .  
They’re in service on the streets in L  .  A  .   right now, as we type  .  
I would rather have these on the streets than thousands of delivery drones in the skies  .  
tracks are a lot of maintenance compared to wheels  .   Tracks can wear out way faster  .  
Best footage I have seen yet but I want to see the whole journey it makes!
the bot looked annoyed to have to open his container for the dude that ordered food  .  
In the future those robots will learn how to fight back so no one steals from them
And they said in future versions it will have an alarm if someone tries to take it
The show must go on! ! Now carry on a stay calm people! ‍️
I saw one recently in Espoo, Finland and I made a short video of it  .  
You can't blame the robots blame the ones who made them to use as an advantage
1950: I bet in the future well have fly cars 2019: car robots that deliver your food
try doing this in London  .   Should be interesting to see what people do to them  .  
It should be delivered in low criminal activity areas not In fast pace areas of residences  .  
Wow really? Didn't know it was already being used somewhere got to check it out
I love the one where it gets hit trying to cross and just backs up in shame
I'm gonna tip them over  .  what they gonna do? Tell their mom?
Idk why you feel sorry for them  .   Lol  .   They are machines not living things  .  
It’s not controlled, it’s done by GPS system and delivers food  .  
What is new about this? At my University we have this to delivery food since 2018  .  
The whole idea is that if we need less cars, we can create bigger sidewalks  .  
Lol we’ve had ones like these on my university campus for a couple years now
Looks just big enough for a 31 year old male to hitch a ride to the shops haha
Delivery drivers are still needed to deliver the robots from the warehouse closer to the location  .  
Wow I have never seen this I lived in Milton keys years ago wasn't there then
This is normal in Milton Keynes, They have been doing this for a few years  .  
Dose he have any beer in there? Lol give it about 10 years  .   Will see   .  
i see these in my area and someone following them what's the name of that job?
Hopefully it knows if you are the real person that ordered something  .   Not a thief  .  
So basically, a copy-cat of this Estonian Starship Robot ? SAME ON YOU , AMAZON  .  
It looks so similar that I am curious if Amazon bought Starship  .  
What if I want to buy one robot   .   How much does it cost to get one   .  
Wow, just like regular delivery, only you need to come down and greet him!
These robots are developed by starship technologies not door dash  .   We just work with door dash
Dude, that's the Estonian food delivery robot developed in cooperation with Tallinn Technological Uni  .  
Why does the robot have front lights like a car??what's the point?
Who else loves watching these robot videos it just makes me feel like the future is coming
I am surprised those haven't all been stolen yet, given how upstanding society is  .  
I swear big city people must have seen some seriously weird stuff not to question Jimmy doing this
they have been given strict orders to run over anyone who doesn't have a coop card  .  
Average Channel a dog's brain is  light-years more capable than any computer we have today  .  
How you gonna tell "THEM" that there is no catalytic converter on this delivery robot
Same with Starship Technologies, it's not fully autonomous and there are humans "Robot Operators"
Here is an answer to a question nobody asked, how many will be hijacked and stolen?
uh, they are usually guarded by a person and that person can control it if needed ?
These are NOT self driving  .   They are remote controlled by staff in the US and India  .  
But can they deliver inside my apartment? Good luck on putting on my gates pass code lol
I have seen people walking with it like a guard or something in Estonia (where it was made in)
We have them at my home in Milton Keynes England, and they go out on the street
They are not fully automated  .   Likely the operator was stopping to be on the safe side  .  
I was looking for an experimental self driving electric Amazon truck with robots for sorting and delivering boxes
They should be paid too  .   I wonder what an AI would do with an actual monthly wage
There are automated supermarket checkouts at some major supermarkets  .   Coming soon to a supermarket near you  .  
I was thinking the same  .   I live too far out for ground-bound robots to be efficient  .  
I agree with all your points  .   I will keep on the lookout for more cool tech!
I mean how much did this cost to do this  .   Money could have been better spent  .  
Domino's tried using these robots in Australia  .   seems like it hasn't launched very well though
Should it "fall" into the garbage can, can it get out?   .   Lol  .  
the robots need an audio system (like Dr Who Daleks saying exterminate) Delivered! Delivered! Delivered!
I live on one of the areas these little things serve, always see them whizzing by  .  
People are being more polite, respectful and courteous to a robot than they would another people being
Remember cow tipping for graduation I wonder if robot tipping is a thing it would be fun ?
They have a charging station pod someone load them up with packages  .   I help build the pods
Not all of us have that option  .   I live well over an hour from most stores  .  
Much like the Drive Thru at MacDonald's and elsewhere, but it is not written in stone  .  
Guess these customers can't rate the robot for a wrong order like they do us humans!
The robots are actually own/created by starship  .  xyz they are doing an experimental run in Redwood City CA  .  
Have you all forgotten about the hitchhiking robot??! Hitchhiking robot died for nothing then!
more likely a driver will hijack your food , it has happened to me a few time
Will these be delivering in the low income parts of cities or just in the Beverley Hells?
They have to equip the robots with screwdrivers to give them a nice scratch in cases like these  .  
More like make amazon pay for when it's crossing at wrong time hence the do not cross sign
EVERY SINGLE ROBOT IN THE WORLD IS CONTROLLED BY AI NOT REMOTES THEY HAVE A MIND OF THEIR OWN
we will see how cute these robots are to JoJo once they are programmed to cook Chinese food  .  
they actually employed more people by hiring the couriers who pick up food from the restaurant  .  
do they work in ice and snow that we have on Canadian sidewalks and roads during the winter ?
Why do we have to tip a robot why do we have to tip a robot someone answer me
I don't see this working in a city  .   It might work in a really small town  .  
When you order you push a button when you get it and it unlocks so you an open it
No one is controlling playmates it is all controlled through AI that’s the same with all robots
If you try to kick it, it will make alarm noises and send tracking information to police  .  
I approached one of these while I was walking with my friends, it rolled right past us  .  
How does the alarm know who's the package is for and who it isn't for?  .  
THAT MUST BE WEST HOLLYWOOD OR WESTWOOD/UCLA…  .  THEM THE ONLY SPOTS I SEE THOSE MOVIN LIKE THAT!!!
For heaven sake when are we gonna get these in Birmingham Hodge Hill , it must use service
Wrong, starship robots are already on duty and the robot in the video is a old model  .  
I saw my first bot going about its business in Cambridge UK 2 days ago  .   They are Here  .  
bruh we are near on the future i mostly see on futuristic anime  .   Time really pass so fast
Have yet to see one in Sweden, I wonder how long until most things are like this  .  
Been in use in MK for years . They can contain approximately 3 x carrier bags worth of food/goods .
They talk to you and play music they are in Milton Keynes Northampton Bedford Cambridge and few other players
Monster Seagulls are very rare in Northampton, its not near any coastline but there are plenty of pigeons
Did it just say thank you!?!? Wait did it ask her to press the button
So I assume it's not fully automated and there is someone operating/monitoring/driving it from a remote location?
They have been going over three years now in Milton Keynes, UK  .   They are really handy  .  
it's no different in London  .   plus you do have them in America  .    .  you had them first
Does the scout only take the packages for one address or can any of my neighbors steal my packages
Where is this Scout's starting point? Does a carrier drop it off on a street corner?
I always wondered what these were and why they have been popping up all over college campuses these days
its a robot, and its 2022 , not 3050 or something, robots are still quite new to us  .  
how it can deliver the food if someone life's in 3rd floor and there is no elevator?!
at that point it's a oversized shopping cart, a flying drone that's fast is way more efficient
I was just outside the Safeway on 4th and King and saw one, that thing is big in person
The interesting question, is with the 2022 Highway code revisions, where do they sit in the priority hierarchy?
Why do you use any kind of CNN for collision avoidance when you have stereo cameras with depth information ?
How do I get a job operating one of these? Is it something I can do from home?
I don’t think it will replace drivers anytime soon! However just we will switch to electric vehicles
2 miles, hmm? Not enough to put anyone out of a job so we are all good here  .  
Maurya you are clearly underage judging by your comment  .   Medical bills cost more than to fix a robot  .  
So every coco is controlled by a pilot, so less jobs for couriers and more jobs for tech people
I am interested to see the percentage of each robot coming back "home" after each delivery trips  .  
you are kidding but you would be surprised by what kind of weird reactions different people have towards these robots!
Ehen, I think they do have a plan B as it can be remotely controlled out of issues!
uhhh this robot gives jobs to people? People are hired to guard the robot and control it if needed
Hahahha what an ignorant  .  the idea of AI is that robots repair robots  .  no humans needed at all
How long does a journey take? This 90 second clip was painfully long to watch, although pretty neat  .  
Clearly a people is driving it, not ‘AI’  .   Would be interesting to follow it home  .  
Reference electric scooter companies in big cities  .   So many different brands but all used a lot by everyone  .  
Let's see it handle a real winter like we get here in Canada then I will be impressed  .  
I've seen on wait for a green light  .   Not sure how it handles crosswalks with no traffic lights  .  
0:16 So, no one is gonna talk about how the robot just took a look at the statue?
*I feel like these robots were invented by Rick Sanchez with only one purpose in life - to deliver food  .  *
I have seen the Starship bots on the campus nearby  .   Sadly I am out of their delivery range  .  
This system can be useful Only few Countries like Japan, Singapore, Finland but, Obviously not in USA
How do they pay robot mart because there is no fixed product, you take whatever quantity you want  .  
Raikkonen starship robots are an Estonian product  .   Tallinn was the very first place to have them roaming around  .  
In the current climate of terror how is this possible ??????????
Little droid  .   I can't believe what I am seeing either  .   I have never seen anything like it 
Use what they want, but don't pretend that thing is green  .   The robot is not green  .  
Are you that stupid to believe they didn’t take into account that people would want to steal  .  
I think it will only open after you confirm that you are next to it to take it out  .  
bruh it’s not alive it doesn’t have feelings it’s just a glorified RC car
I would love to see these things be the size of normal shopping carts for grocery stores and supermarkets!
the flag on top of antenna is for the cars to see it better when it crosses the road  .  
so  .  it's an rc car with a camera that they will drive your food to you in  .  
Pretty sure they didn't have to make you have to open the rear end to get your food out
Funny how there is so much technology, yet we are still running on gas, I wonder why  .  
Most probably it has someone driving it at some stages  .   For going into the lift and those things  .  
then they get sued for shocking random people that touch it, not knowing what it was at first  .  
Tonight's news, a homeless man was threaten and beaten senseless by a robot who claimed self defense!
"Without an ounce of people interaction"   .   Umm, I thought that was a good thing ;-;
It transforms into Optimist Prime  .   With the assumption you’ll be a good person and leave it alone…
When coop lead on something like this it makes you wonder , they can’t even staff a checkout productively
we have these on my campus and they like wait to go into the street until there are no cars lol
I would be entertained for hours playing basically with a remote RC car watching people react to this driving by  .  
How fast or how can this device travel? Can this device function during rainy days or during bad weather?
I need to buy one that can go up and down stairs and get in and out of my car  .  
I love how it books when it's in the middle of the street, like it feels unsafe there  .  
they’re already on college campuses across the United States  .   They are in selected cities, as well  .  
Watched 1 go passed my daughters house deliver then return to co-op in Kempston  .   They have loads of them outside  .  
how is it gonna go to the 12th floor in a apartment when a customer wants it in his door?
Saw one of these three years ago in Cleveland  .   Don't forget many urban deliveries are done by bicycle  .  
Wait can anyone just open the robot and steal your lunch, what if we could pet the robot
Reminds me of the starship robots I have seen on the streets of Tallinn, and of that self driving bus
Went and bought the wife a car from Northampton and they had them there as well it’s mind blowing
In less than 10 years time, they will be delivering all sorts of goods by robot flight (except Washing Machines)  .  
It's made using fossil fuels, and the battery is charged by fossil fuels  .   Green is a scam  .  
Seems like a neat idea for last mile delivery  .   Might need a bit of self defense just in case  .  
Walmart already testing drones from Pea Ridge and Rodgers AR they work very well  .   Much faster Zipline from San Francisco
This is meant to reduce labor  .   It's eventually gonna become reality whether luddites like you care or not
Interesting robot but how long think they last  .   Going be people out there taking these
Biden corrected you It was illegally hit people crossing the sailor of the right away until the crossing sign is fully red
How can this cost much less? Still have the workers driving the robots unless  paying even less money now  .  
Lmao they probably found another job within the company they worked with no need to get so worked up about the future
I just want to sit on top of it and ride it everywhere it’s going! It looks fun!
I am impressed at how it navigated the first tree, but even more mystified at why I am so interested  .  
what's stopping anyone from just grabbing it and stealing it  .   and how does it cross the street without getting run over
It is remotely controlled when he gets into a situation it can't get out of because unable to make a decision
"Sir step back or I ama have to shoot you" "it's just a robot!!!!"
Robot: Delivering food Random person: Tries too steal it Robot: OH SNAP! LET ME CALL THE ROBO'S
Solar would work with some LiCoO 2's, maybe not 24/7 operation but at least 8hrs  .   Charge during the day deliver at night
I think this will be good in certain situations like now with Coronavirus, but with other thing its not as good
Speaking of Jetsons I wonder if it can go up elevators  .   Bet you got to meet it on ground level  .  
Great video! Saw these around Berkeley a couple years ago and always wondered how the whole operation works  .   Thanks!
2 bucks  .  ? That's nothing  .   I live in New Hampshire and pay 5 bucks plus tip to get a pizza delivered  .  
"I deliver to Oakland" more like "I get in everybody's way and I am a discount Wall-E"
They are all monitored in a control room  .   Multiple screens from each starship bot are being monitored at the same time
In time they’re gonna make a law that you have to stop so they can cross the street  .  
now i know why all of the sidewalks in Columbus have been updated, I thought it was for handicapped people :)
First of all it can and might have cameras for security  .   Secondly you can put some sophisticated alarm system on  .  
Great idea  .   This will be big blow for uber eats and the likes once they are into full scale deployment  .  
So because you go from Droid to robot who delivered food, what is the cost pass on to the customers?
2021 and still no robots   .   you' would think with the pandemic you would see those things all over the map   .  
how would they catch a homeless guy  .   Look up robot tries to hitch hike across country & see what happened to it
It's still being developed into full automation  .   It obviously needs people help until they have perfected the bloody robot  .  
Someone has to build, fix, and maintain the  robots, (until they build robots that can do those jobs)  .  
You know LA is dangerous when Uber eats and door dash said now we will let the slow robots handle that one  .  
Why is it geared down so much it’s so slow  .   First one I’ve seen with a pilot though
That's more of an infrastructure issue  .   Not much room between that beautiful old tree and the edge of the sidewalk  .  
LIDAR is most probably too expensive to put on small robots for mass production and would probably increase their price by a lot  .  
The student can own share (tokens) in the bots or manage fleets of them and be better off than working at minimum wage
What's stopping someone from lifting the lid and nicking the food? I mean , that's south London!
they are so reminiscent of Huey, Dewey and Louie in the movie "silent running" they need a voice box  .  
What happened to this Kiwibot? Is it a zombie? It has "X" as eyes  .   Dead bot rolling  .  
However how that robot for use "wheels road off" it can there if happened snow on sidewalks some it stuck?
In the US in many parts sidewalks is just not a thing  .   I wonder if this thing can get on the road
Curious to see how something like this would manage in cold northern climates when the roads and sidewalks are covered in snow & ice…
They are used everywhere in Northampton  .   Mainly the co-op stores use them and a couple of chip shops I know of  .  
That was funny, although I wonder how long it was staying there  .   Tell someone came along an pushed the button  .  
Some say that sometimes you can hear the cart mumbling something about the stupid designers not giving it arms to push buttons  .  
No but they most likely have some people overseeing them to make sure the alarms aren't going off or physically being manhandled
So there in Arizona? We don’t have the Amazon ones here,, just the white Starship food delivery bot
Lol saw two of these on the university of Houston's campus 2 days ago, felt like I was in a movie lmao
This may take your delivery jobs, but if you learn how to repair these robots you will have a more meaningful job
Rich area  .   Low crime  .   Try this in Oakland  .   Or Richmond and let's see how long this will work  .  
I mean that's cool and all but the Safeway on Bernal has those carts with little cars attached to the front  .  
Are they driven by AI or is there a person in a central control place controlling the little fellers? Or a mix?
Leaving the scene of a vehicle collision is a crime in Germany  .   Could the company behind the robots get fined for it?
What if the robot gets hit by something or any vehicle? The repairing will cost you more than to hire a delivery person
Next things next these things will come out the back of a driverless van  .   There will be delivery drones oh yeah dig it
plus snow can get robots with wheels be stuck too since they had greater chance unless snow is thick enough but same for tracks
I don’t think it will replace humans anytime soon! Humans will continue to delivery food and packages for years to come
is it just me or do others now want to order food to a dead body and see what the police do about it
​ Music my friend worked for one of these companies  .   while I don't doubt some are auto, most are RC  .  
Biggest fail in business yet  .   Robots that can't properly replace people are a massive fail  .   This is one perfect example  .  
I am assuming they will have to build slightly different versions for different climates  .   I believe UPS does that with their trucks  .  
Milton Keynes is a city built from scratch in the 1960s  .   The robot probably wouldn’t work in the rest of the up
How can it be cost effective considering they have to have someone watching them the whole time as well as every other cost involved…
We have one of them things here in Toronto , Ontario   .   They are Pink and it's owned by Tiny mile Delivery   .  
Its a copy-paste of Estonian Starship Robot  .   We have them on the Tallinn street over a year  .   Everybody can google it!
or they are equipped with locking mechanisms and 360 cameras to prevent that? Seriously, the lack of innovation in people society is depressing  .  
They have job positions posted to be the person who loads the items into it, and helps it when it gets stuck  .  
That robot is built by Estonia and I'm from Estonia so yeah   .   They can built more but our robot is on beta testing
Yeah, I think that's how it works  .   If you try picking it up en route it will sound an alarm  .  
Because this can travel in any weather and is more realistic  .   Plus they already are working on drone delivery, check out Wing  .  
That's hilarious  .   It crossed on a "do not walk" signal too, but I guess it's not technically walking  .  
That cold be a workable solution to Latin American poverty  .   "Hey Jose would you rather drive robots instead of pick fruit?"
That's wrong, they are very aware of any "obstacles"   .   Benefits for local journeys are zero petrol, zero fumes & pollution  .  
I estimate that there is a short-term interest  .   But let's give it a try  .   As a whole, not particularly convenient  .  
This shows only the good things about those robots what about the bad things think about that thank you take care and peace out  .    .  
How is that a robot? More like an RC-Car  .   What is the point if you still need a person to drive it?
Entitled d-bag cant be bothered to put his dog on a leash so instead he kicks over a robot because he’s most important
Should swipe on delivery address after security id for truly none people contact tactless for hygiene reason ( likes some kitchen bins and tapes motion operated)
it will go beyond that  .   they have robot hotels and restaurants too now where a lot of the front end staff are robots  .  
program it to roll on the left  .   or on the right if you are  .   i don't know the pedestrian rules in the up  .  
And how did the Amazon 6 wheels get over the curb?, FedEx just loves to fall down stairs! - Tech for tech sake!
It uses Segway technology  .   The same base is used in a wheelchair that can climb stairs with a 300 lbs  .   people on board  .  
That's awesome! It's nice to see that Tesla and Uber have competition that's not gonna clog up the roads  .  
i didn't even know about these, i am 59 years old, i remember before color tv, when our tv was black and white
Poor fella  .   You don't get it, do you? This _is_ the new normal  .   The old life is gone forever  .  
Keeping this for only elites is kind of of a good thing, so that delivery workers don't lose their jobs any time soon  .  
So are these things fully autonomous using maps and radar or are they being driven like a drone and someone using an FPV visor?
Imagine that robot having the owners "face recognition" somewhere in it's hardware and starting pepper spraying if you are not the owner
What happens when the lady doesn't come out? I wonder if it truly emulates people behavior and throws it against your door  .  
just in time   .   they are getting rid of the immigrant food delivery guys that don't speak English for a robot that doesn't speak English
They should have a delivery robot that delivers your packages up to your door and says hasta la vista baby in Arnold Schwarzenegger voice  .  
They might not be actually stuck they might just not be able to navigate because of the snow and can't tell which way to go
Not sure how they are worried about "theft" if they literally keep stuff in a basket on top of the robot's head  .  
The video says "totally secure  .  " How? Those things are gonna get stolen left and right and quickly deactivated and hacked  .  
Make sure you send this video to the company that responsible for the making this delivery  .   I am sure they want to press charges  .  
Did you know that Door Dash has a comic book?  it's about super hero door dasher  .   They are taking it serious  .  
This was from 10month ago sun news just put it on using it for delivery to nhs workers everything is falling into place I seem to think
Don’t worry, if you download the app and when it comes to your door, you can remotely open it from the app
if we have this technology then why aren’t big retailers using this during lockdown to deliver food to vulnerable people????
Starship employs 100 operators to remotely control the robots during tricky situations, and that the firm won’t have fully self-driving bots any time soon
The ones mentioned here are all latecomers, I have seen delivery robots in operation in China 2 years ago already like the JD and Alibaba  .  
One got hit by a train and it’s friends watched the sad moment “Sorry, your order was crushed by a train”
I haven’t personally used them but see them around  .   I haven’t ran into any issues wth respect to them being in the way
I don't think they will have as many problems with theft and vandalism as some expected  .   Most people are just intrigued by them  .  
Yes they have been here in Milton Keynes for a few years now, probably because there are so many lazy bastards here in MK  .  
I saw one in Lewisham, South London but it had a man with it making sure it was able to cope with the terrain  .  
I never heard it say "Can you please press the walk button?" Other than "Thank you, have a nice day"
I wonder what the failure rate on these little guys is  .   It’s really awesome but there are always mistakes to be made!
So wait  .  if they get an order from the delivery app the chef will prioritize that order, versus those already waiting in line?
I feel like when robots take all the jobs, humans should get a daily payout or something so it will be fair for them  .  
how does it know when to cross streets, etc.  .   or they are controlled from the HQ in the future
what about when raining or snow?
Why is your name "Kiwi" ? What connection do you have with New Zealand? Wouldn't a Colombian name be more suitable?
They should either be equipped with a stronger horse power or better wheels or just change them out with a different model to handle the weather  .  
Imagine they had something nice like this in NYC  .   It would get robbed, destroyed and vandalized In Minutes  .   Ppl are fucking assh9les in NYC
Do they disinfect the robots after a delivery is complete? Or does it goes from one house to the other spreading the “virus”?
They should make them in a form of a large egg, completely slippery eggshell surface so anyone trying to grab it would not able to  .  
It's locked  .   The person who ordered whatever it is has to text a code to either the shop or the robot to unlock it  .  
Ahaha yes, I wonder how they programmed "fear" in him but his "body language" definitely conveys terror of crossing and being hit
Do these things work with batteries if they do why then people say they take over the world Can one explain that for me please Many thanks
I think this depends on the area  .   Cities that traditionally more controlled like Singapore, Shanghai, or Tokyo could minimize potential of third-party problem  .  
The music was to calm and distract you  .   It recognized a young white male and played pop rock to pacify while it made it's getaway  .  
Bruh you serious it’s a fucking train over some lifeless robot I feel more sorry for the people that won’t get their food
Radar would be great I know the use ultra Sonic, but it can't see through objects  .   The radar would help and maybe some vision learning
I am speculating on a future where these robots become mainstream established  .   What are your thoughts on the future of public robot legislation (including my comment)?
They will not replace lorry drivers until they devise software that makes robots drive side by side for miles on end, for no reason at all  .  
Instead of delivering tacos  .   Get it to fix road potholes  .   So people can drive down the road and not bust their car in two pieces  .  
How about if i was sleeping what's it gonna do then  .   Or if i have stairs ???  WE ARE GETTING A BIT LAZY  .  
I am assuming the door on the robot would not be programmed to open until it reaches its destination  .   Is that why the thief was unsuccessful?
Did you see anyone "Just run off with them and take them apart"? If not then the answer is no, if yes then yes
I went back a few days later and the whole edge of the kerb is covered in white markings  .   I am assuming they regularly fall off there!
I think that instead of giving jobs to everybody we should try to find a way to change our society so that we don't have to work  .  
Wtf   .  yesterday i watched an old TV podcast where they were talking about this robot and how it functions  .   and now it get recommended to me  .  
They’ve just rolled these out in my area and you know what I didn’t think of the visually impaired people who people in wheelchairs  .  
Just another tool for the ultra rich to stay ultra rich this is not better or faster it’s cheaper for the elites to get your money  .  
not sure why people are choosing food delivery and paying for delivery around 30% of the cost of food  .   not even talking about ingredients quality and so on  .  
Give it tracks with spikes  .   No solution is ever gonna fit every situation but even with just tires they can reach a majority of the population  .  
Can’t believe these are new to anybody now  .   Seen them about for ages  .   MK was the first place I saw them also, oddly  .  
We have robotic (self-driving) buses here in Estonia already (this robot is also developed in Estonia), and the ride on the bus is completely free of charge  .  
I wonder what improvements can be made to minimize accidents like this in the future  .   Starship Technologies, hire me and I’ll help find a way  .  
Girl: What if kids sit on it? Inventor: yeah, that's not gonna happen  .   It's not meant to sit on!! Hahahahahahahahahahahhahahaa
More importantly, do they mean plastic grocery bags or paper grocery bags? Because paper bags hold a lot more than those little plastic ones they give out  .  
So it's gonna do about 2 deliveries I don't understand the point  .   Is it gonna travel miles away from the terminal f or a few packages
Well, I mean, aside from this there's normal food delivery operated by humans  .   Which I don't think is specific to the US, no?
Oh you mean sending it around observing/tracking people? I am pretty sure there's a regulation on data retention and use for whatever those cameras and GPS track  .  
I saw some of these visiting my the other day and I was bewildered at everyone acting like there wasn't a little robot going about it's business lol
Yup lmao  .   They will try to figure out how to not deliver to bad neighborhoods and areas in whichever city  .   The greedy MFers won't succeed though  .  
If they bring one of those to the Midlands it better have Terminator Technology or its going in the canal to join its technologically challenged sibling the shopping trolley  .  
I hope it doesn’t become standard, that we talk to machines like humans, at least as long humans have problems to talk to each other…  .  
I am from Milton Keynes in the UK  .   We have a load of these robots that have been operating in our area for the last couple of years  .  
The robot itself isn't invented my Door Dash, it's invented by Estonian startup Starship Technologies  .   Door Dash is just working together with them to test/use the robots  .  
what if you tie your shirt around the face and is the gps on the food or the robot? sorry i forgot to include this in my last comment
Will not work for all communities  .   But just profile an area's demographics and you can easily see where this robot service will have success with minimal risks  .  
Poor India can't even think about it because of their very  poor infrastructure mainly poor roads However, India has S400 but not enough toilets What an irony  .  
I believe so, I heard somewhere if you pick it up it plays a alarm  .   But that might just be the one that’s on the campus  .  
Human voice via mic, my guess is it had been stuck there for a while  .   Was nasty weather, and only reason I was out was to make deliveries
I haven't used it yet  .   On seeing the video, right now, the most effective way to use these little guys is delivering things between close neighborhoods  .  
Amazing…but I’m not holding my breath for its arrival to our village in Wiltshire  .   Here we are still wondering what all this hype is about the Automobile  .  
This is filmed in my home town; the robots deliver groceries from our local Co-op  .   They are super cute trundling about, we always shout if we spot one
Is this real i know the machine is but do they actually talk to us that's insane soon they’ll be having small talk while we wait for the light
McRocket paved asphalt motorways are hardly 100 years old yet today pervade every street  .   with more establishment of autonomous vehicles streets could be far more different in the next 100 years  .  
Someone stealing it in the city won't get far since it's got 4 surrounding cameras, dual-GPS locator and a 5g chip  .   Unless the jail is far, then yeah  .  
this is simply amazing, I see them day by day 'working' their asses around the Broughton area down in Milton Keynes  .   They always busy and they never stop haha  .  
These will be great in areas with lots of paving  .   Humans will still have to deliver packages to places like the countryside where it’s usually very muddy and uneven
Hi America, you should try changing you cities and make them more for pedestrians, and not for cars, and then you can try walking to the grocery store  .  
​ Seeing the low payment a people gets for these delivery services, I somewhat doubt, that they will ever be able to compete with an (e)bike delivery service  .  
they do talk to you  .   I find them queued up sometimes at the crossing by my house, and they ask you to press the button so they can cross  .  
"Thomas the Tank Engine" "My Little Blue Wagon" "Fisher-Price Portable Kitty Litter Box" Can you think of any more new names for the "Scout"
its real I'm a ups driver I have seen them before  .   Never knew exactly how it was supposed to work if the customer has to come out and take the pkg
It will most probably be pricey for those "bad neighborhoods" any way  .   But like you said, rather not risk the robot be disassembled by capitalism's flaws  .  
Put a food lift in it so the customer doesn't have to put the food and drink on the ground where crap has been from other people's shoes  . 
I think they are only in Milton Keynes? I know they started there, and as far as I know, they haven't been set up in other areas yet  .  
I just hope that they don't get in the way too much and use the "right" side of the sidewalk and I don't have to walk around it  .  
Idk what company makes these robots but Door Dash has their own robots similar to this and the goal of the CEO isn't to replace the people workers but the robots are complementary
Ok but that’s just theft  .   it’s nothing new, plus it’s a robot  .   it can’t feel pain, and it has security  .  
If the robot could deliver it, a walking person could also deliver it and earn money  .   Who owns the robot? they would make a ton of money?
Is it the same price or an extra charge for delivery? I wonder if it can deliver to the upper floors of a building  .   Now that would be very convenient  .  
Does it deliver one package at a time to one house then go back to the warehouse, or does the customer rifle through everyone's packages and only take their own?
Curious to find out what stops someone on the sidewalk from walking up and taking your package as it opens  .   Considering most people with jobs aren't home during delivery hours  .  
I wonder if it's got some sort of AI on it? I can't find any explanation on how it knew what was happening and how it said thank you  .  
I work at  robotic order packing company, and know, your probably not wrong! Those things are driven by people in Latin America, it's a person not a robot
Because their so helpless, I assume it's some sort of thing in our brain about protecting children, but idk Something like little robot boy cute  .   Must help little robot boy
I've saw one blaring a alarm before and heard that they can call the police they ask people to help them cross the road not sure if they do it all the time though
A fun concept, it's pretty cool how it asked to pass  .   I hope it works out though, and these little guys go on delivery food without too much issue  .  
Only when they get stuck, as in they don't know what to do to get out of a specific situation (as far as I know), a people can remotely intervene  .  
**Robot hits the curb and falls over** Detective: It seems the victim was out shopping  .   Media: How do you know? Detective: We found food items all over the scene
Living on a steep hill in Seattle how would the robot climb up the street hill ?? maybe a mini robotic station up on top of hill? compete with Safeway??
Anyone been run over by one yet ?   .   Are they insured / have a license to use pedestrians foot path ?   .   MSM sugarcoating bs   .   Meanwhile nhs wards empty except for dancing  .  
Milton Keynes has been working on autonomous vehicles for 10-15 years  .   The grid layout of the city wasn't random  .   i hope you don't think this is a good future btw  .  
So the people getting some exercise and saving some money by visiting the cafe in person will have their orders put on hold when someone orders with the robot? Money certainly talks!
Oh man, this reminds me of the Flight of the Navigator food delivery cart  .   Except it's autonomous, thus negating the role of Sarah Jessica Parker, which I appreciate!
In that case it's still convenient to distinguish between a car and a trash container  .   You don't want the robot to wait forever ;-) Not sure I get your point though
Very great that he took good care of his pup in that regard  .   However, because the dog is near a street, having she/he on a leash is safer for the dog  .  
That small flag is supposed to make the robot visible to cars and pedestrians?!?! I think it has to be at least as noticeable as humans to avoid causing collisions!
I think that their vision is the same at night, due to IR, but - this said - I have rarely seen them at night given the stores for which they deliver are closed ‍️
Spot on  .   I live in MK & regularly see them while I am out running  .   I have never had local shopping or a take-away delivered, which is the function these robots perform  .  
  .    .   or we could just have walkable cities, where you could walk two minutes to pick up food and then two minutes back, like this idea is still based in car centrality  .  
i would be ok around Clifton  .   and maybe Cotham/Redland  .   i think that would be about it  .   even those posh areas like sneyd park sometimes get the little scrotes from henbury going through
I live in a hilly city up north  .   Just wondering how well these robots would cope here  .   Not to mention the less well behaved youths having some ‘fun’ with them!
​ you are literally contradicting yourself bud  .   By that asshole kicking that robot the robot companies will eventually build weapons into it because of dickheads like that  .   Guess you are a dickhead too  .  
He really didn't look angry at all  .   It seem very "oh man did that Machine scare you little guy? Here I got it, you are safe now let's go"
robot world create more jobs like robot technician jobs  .   in the future millions of robots need repair so this want to be people jobs  .   we keep already big robot name internet so don't worry
To be honest, in my area I haven't seen any get abused, apart from an elderly gentleman that refused to move  .   The robot stood its ground and the man had to retreat
This will only make them up their game on their technology  .   You think you are hurting them by exposing it, you are helping them  .   You are like a free quality control department!
give those robots access to the second amendment to protect themselves against racists  .   those robots need to earn a living to feed their families and in the end they just want to get home safe
Great to see the robot is still working hard  .   How does it compare to scooter food delivery? And was Amazon Prime's blue delivery robot using your robot or did they stole the idea?
Pizza the company has live people in South America that drive those robots through the street  .   There's a caveat that show them where to navigate the robot  .   It's called a Kiwi Bot  .  
Didn't you hear that these are prototypes and that it would take probably ten years before the are fully operational  .   One has to start somewhere and robots are dumb
Actually they are being made over the sea in Tallinn, Estonia  .   Sweden is probably the closest place for Estonia to export them, so why haven't you already taken them in? :D
The direction of flight is more direct, and consequently more efficient, than the myriad pathfinding necessary to traverse across surfaces  .   Consequently, I expect that aeronautic robots shall be more efficient at delivery  .  
I never had one, I just remember seeing the adverts for it at the time  .   Suppose these days you could just make a similar thing using an Arduino board and some DIY electrical parts  .  
People don't want to work they want to be able to live happily  .   In our society you would need to have money and so to work but it doesn't have to be like this  .  
To resolve this debate, companies would need the carts/drones, have a master combo vehicle, that holds the drones and bot carts, like an car/truck/Rv sub central mobile delivery which adapts to location stops  .  
Haha, fair point  .   Often people instinctively think of the things they might not be able to do that humans can - but also important to remember we have human-based services and they come with their own drawbacks
Hopefully it can be improved with additional safety mechanisms to lock and even use of potentially digital QR codes or otherwise on a lid mounted screen to be unlocked with a smartphone? Great concept even so  .  
People are so negative with their brain and that’s why we can’t have anything nice and new  .   A bomb? Give me a break, I’ll bet the person is white  .  
I agree to some extent but technology is mostly used by lazy folks  .   Uber eats, online shopping and more have high usage  .   This will take over many things even if we like it or not  .  
why don’t you do a little research and you will find out it isn’t absurd at all and it’s actually how they function  .   There was a whole news report on it  .  
I have seen them out and about in Los Angeles  .   I heard they are electrified with 10,000 volts to shock the living shit out of anyone who tries to snatch them before they have reached their destination  .  
Door dash did not develop the robot! The company behind it is Starship Technologies  .   This type of delivery system was implemented many  months ago in Hamburg, Germany  .   It's not really a new thing  .  
Rovers can be used for patrolling the campus, as surveillance cameras, detector lost metal objects, collecting garbage, a mouthpiece for announcements, a talking clock, a reference and even a spy following a suspect  .  
For while now, but it's low key  .   It's on a need to know basis as to slowly introduce the robotic rights so us Humans won't know what happed, until it's too late  .  
Awesome idea, you still have a person pick the food up so idk why he cant just continue like other apps  .   I understand he can grab multiple orders but with that wont the first order get cold?
I will predict that in 15 years or so we will have automous tricycle delivery robots that can shift from driving on a sidewalk and driving on a road with traffic, going from slow to fast for longer distances  .  
People used to say the same about communal bicycle systems in cities, and yet the evidence doesn't support your argument, of course there will be some theft, but no more so than for any item  .  
Yeah, I agree electric bikes can really cover a good part of your needs  .   I would say except for when you have to go buy a lot of groceries or if you have to transport someone around  .  
but cycling back - I live in Brooklyn and have about 20 shops and restaurants within 2 blocks from me  .   If that thing can deliver within 4-5 blocks, it covers 95% of my needs (I personally prefer to get my stuff myself though )
In some ways, they are a disadvantage when it comes to registering every drone into the FAA  .   While it is safer for the robots and more time efficient, these drones can be very expensive to buy  .  
The design is like Wall-E mixed with Minions, the robot could have some signal lamps and a voice, and if it falls over is stuck there until someone picks it up  .   Try turning over a car  .  
There's a number of different companies that are working on them, so it could have been an earlier model or another company's bot  .   A pilot study or failure do seem like the most likely explanations  .  
Check out the small Co-op shop on Newton Road in Bletchley (Milton Keynes) They have about 15 of them parked outside all bucking around and getting loaded up by staff, funny to watch, they have built in Sat Navs
I live on that road and we have them go by so many times, I can’t believe you never knew about them DJ ? Wait until you see 3 or 4 all in a row as they set out…
Will it open up to anyone or were there need to be a confirmation authorization to open and receive a package like facial recognition or a scanning from an individual state Id need be implemented in processing the transaction  .  
Yea, I wish we could still have the elevator guy, or the guy going around lighting the street lamps at night, or the guy delivering milk bottles in the morning  .   No of course I don't  .  
That's an interesting POV  .   Why would it work better in Japan? My idea of JP is that's way more crowded and chaotic than suburban California, hence more difficult for it to navigate around  .   No?
Ah, I saw people testing these guys in the city here in California! They have a person behind the robot making sure it isn't tampered with  .   But soon they will be automated running on their own!
initially these robots look vulnerable, but that on board camera has got to help prevent all sorts of crimes long term, at night they are a much safer option for vulnerable people, more power to the robots!
I bet if you could obtain an ecu from Elon Musks Tesla and a compatible gps you could incorporate it into any delivery system moving under let's say 120kph speeds  .   I would think a heavy drone would be perfect!
You can have a heart attack and die as well  .   Let's be honest - There was a time when people thought, that cars could never replace our four-legged friends  .   But, as you can see - the opposite happened  .  
The problem is, that its ALREADY BEEN DONE lol  .   Warehouses already are pretty automated and have these robots running around keeping stuff in stock  .   I know that some hospitals in the US already have something similar already  .  
A Sandwich That's where I first saw them too! I was like “Is that Amazons new robots?” But then I remember hearing about Robots being placed on Pittsburgh college campuses (unrelated to Amazon) on the news  .  
There are no employees that start remote controlling the bots  .   The bot tries to get unstuck by itself and if it can't, then there's nothing an employee can do remotely so it makes absolutely no sense  .  
FYI, these have people that are manually operating these and can ask for help pressing crosswalk buttons and are viewing their routes  .   It’s not just a random robot picking up items from my house to yours lol  .  
they have *room* to advance, sound, speed and behavior, a sidewalk, doesn't like to be tild this  .   Drones are now big enough to be a passenger flight travels, 2kg is no longer the scale limit  .  
For the most part they are autonomous robots but if they need assistance then a people operator can manually operate them by watching through the built-in cameras and using a controller on their mobile device or by way of a PC  .  
It reminds me of some toy you could get in the 80's that you could program to bring your drink or snack or whatever, looks quite similar as well  .   Just looked it up and it was called Big Track  .  
Mate  .   I love your videos but, you’re a bit hyper aren’t you  .   It’s an electrically driven bucket on wheels with a few sensors on it following a predetermined route   .   Get over it
All right tell me the law about this if I walk up and take the food out there and my robbing a person or Robbing the machine a piece of equipment , product who ore what am I robbing???
Kroger is experimenting with drones too  .   It's and old company, but the largest food retailer in the U  .  S  .   with nearly 3,000 stores  .   They are constantly experimenting with technology and have enjoyed high growth in digital systems and delivery  .  
The robots being "Complimentary" to the drivers and taking the routes they don't want is how they get them in there to start  .   Give it enough time and they will be doing the regular deliveries as well  .  
50 years away from automation robot food delivery  .   Most of us will be in the upper room by then  .   Delivery robots will only work in n the super rich neighborhoods with Police and armed security is in every book and cranny  .  
Looks like they are testing them, and the only way I can think they would be useful is when all the people are gone, they were testing drones yesterday for delivery also  .   Do they know something we don't?
Lower class/income neighborhoods will never see this regardless of country  .   Maybe even standard middleclass  .   This is reserved for upper middle class and the elite, as most likely there wont be people trying to steal or mess with the robot  .  
should have pop out stabilizers to help with falling over any way ? this guy did the company a favor to show a weakness is it's flawed design  .   LOL and dog really should be on a leash to be fair  .  ?
Why not utilize electric vans for that? For groceries, those are significantly more efficient, and are able to be unloaded by a large machine or people operator  .   The latter even provides some pleasant people interaction for those old folk  .  
Co-Op using them here in Northampton, and they are not being just used on nice quiet access routes but on routes needing them to cross very busy arterial roads, they've been running around the town for at least 18 months or more  .  
I think they should send a code to the person ordering the food, and lock the robot, so that nobody could steal the food  .   When the robot arrive the persons house, he would just open it using the code  .  
Comber umm actually no  .   If the robot gets stuck for example in this situation a person who is monitoring the robots will take control and will bring it back to it's path, then it will resume it's autonomous drive again  .  
it only saves money for company  .   Customers will do most of work  .   Think about gas stations, groceriy stores, fast food price have not went down  .   You bag, ring, pump your gas and price have not went down  .  
These robots usually won't deliver direct to your door  .   I suppose if you want that you would just have to go for the regular humanoid delivery option  .   I am guessing that this option will be cheaper, especially for short distances  .  
I have never seen that before but I have heard a few years back they were go to use flying drones for delivering items here in NZ  .   It never happened  .   Stay safe and enjoy the rest of your day  .  
These robots were invented in Estonia and these have been tested out all over in our capital Tallinn (I see these often)  .   Estonia is a tiny country where also Skype, TransferWise etc.  .   are from  .   we have actually so many start-ups  .  
As someone who develops tech, I can tell you that the worst part about this industry are consumers who think that 5 years is a long enough time period to completely develop and test something as complex and interdisciplinary as a self driving car  .  
Will you be mounting cameras and sensors lower on it closer to the ground to record insurance fraud attempts like the it rolled over foot claim  .   Has no one tagged your bot yet  .   You could contract with the city to do surveillance too  .  
no footage of them going up and down steps, stairs etc.  .  ?! The elephant in the room! Plus - the age old argument   .   why can't these jobs be done by humans? There are loads of peeps who need jobs fgs  .  
And thief's can't mug a regular delivery driver? A thief who's capable of cracking one of these is most likely to ambush and steal cargo trucks worth thousands of dollars than robbing a delivery bot for goods that probably cost less than 50 bucks
If it's interfered with it alerts it's control who have visual on it  .   Not just local Tesco but also local Co-op, local chippy & local Chinese takeaway on the estate where I live! In some areas they use normal pavements too  .  
I want to know how it gets unstuck if something is on the sidewalk or someone tips it over…some jobs we shouldn’t try to replace humans with robots for…every president promotes creating jobs but the tech world seems to glorify robots that take jobs away…
I think it was mostly for compact ability since it would also switch between a high speed vehicle and a low speed vehicle  .   It made sense to me, but I see your points  .   Curbs and steep hills would be more difficult for a tricycle  .  
Robots see the world in a much more different way to live beings  .   They use more basic algorithms and data analysis to do what they do, but in reality even the most advanced robots of today aren't nearly as intelligent as a rat  .  
So my question is if ordering in the app not only allows people to skip the queue but also get priority food preparation, why would anyone queue up - surely then everyone will just use the app and you’ll get the queue issues there?
I wonder if robots like this would help physically change cities not just by reducing the need for cars and car parks but also by further encouraging making sideways more user-friendly by increasing the amount of wheel-friendly sidewalks for wheelchairs, strollers, bikes etc.  .  
Bennett I think this is not standard GPS (like in phone) - I tested my robot and big problem with position - GPS show point on road ( accuracy 3 m ) - no problem for a man but this is more than pathway width - so very important camera and software (it looks for obstacles)
These punching guys and even their skateboards will carry soon a digital identity which will expose their actions to the officer robot… and this guy will not be fun to attack  .   You use already fancy tech to film them  .   Same tech will bring attackers to law  .  
The only way this is a viable idea is if there is a larger truck nearby that this can dock with and reload  .   Also it seriously needs to be able to deploy the package somehow, but then this would be a porch pirates dream come true  .  
Johanna I hear you but  .   Would you tip a robot? And  .   Would you get a delivery from a person just because you want to tip them? Good point though, maybe they should include a way to tip the restaurant instead of the delivery robot ‍️
Waste of time if the truck that drops them off waits for it to return before going on to the next point  .   Will only work if there are a number of deliveries relatively close to each other and they can all be set off at the same time  .  
These things are actually remotely controlled by humans  .   One would assume that it would be equipped with a device to signal for help  .   I would also hate to see how it handles a real winter with feets of snow that is freshly blanketing the ground and still loose  .  
lol it looks like something out of a sci-fi movie from the 90's like "Flight of the navigator" or summink! Nice to see we have finally caught up with the times (sigh) - what next belated flying cars from the "Back to the Future" trilogy??
But then you are already next to it to take it out  .   I think it will only open via amazon app when you press open in the app  .   Then you can take it out, just you would open the trunk of your car with the car key  .  
Why a tricycle as opposed to a robot with 4 wheels? 4 wheels offers inherently more stability as all as the ability to send variable amounts of power to all 4 wheels based on changing obstacles and conditions decreasing the chance it would get stuck on a curb or going up a hill etc.…
Veramonte's actually they are controlled and monitored by a human, a friend of mine does this job, its called "pilot"  .   Every now and then they have open jobs on their website, check it out haha! (It also states you need an Xbox or ps controller)
We do have crime in MK, but the general feel of the place does seem friendlier than most places  .   These are fitted with GPS & cameras  .   They deliver the type of things people used to walk to the shops to get  .   They cannot deliver your weekly shopping  .  
The ultimate consequence of privacy is total stagnation of innovation and disconnection  .   Fools such as yourself cause it  .   Consequently, I hope that it continues to monitor me; the more that observes the world, the more information that is provided to remediate the problems that afflict humanity  .  
Actually they do have rear indicators; the rear lights double as turn signals (saw it first hand)  .   Got at least three shops with them near me; no issues with them as to pavement jams  .   Now people blocking the way by walking astride for no reason  .   that's common
A lot of comments here mention the potential for theft and damage but people used to say the same about communal bicycle systems in cities, and yet the evidence doesn't support the argument! Of course there will be some theft, but no more so than for any item  .  
and do what with it? Sell it? It's a heavy, camera monitored and GPS tracked brick to any potential thieves that wouldn't have much use for it  .   and for sure no one would want to pay money for it if they know it's being tracked  .  
I am a senior (65+) now, and the last thing you want to do is eat pizza  .   I just had one of the robots come up behind me while I was on the phone in the middle of Fairfax, not the campus  .   I had no clue they were in operation  .  
I am a driver for ups and these are kind of a thing I have seen them before  .   Not sure how they can tackle some of the issues like special instructions not home most customers aren't so idk how all that will work  .   Faster to have a person doing it  .  
There Very Proud of these robots they take photos   .    .  What THE   .  REALLY   .  Why is you not proud of people that work hard hours in cold to get food to you   .    .  does that not have Real Meaning   .   Wish people would support me as much as they do that TRASH Bot   .  
Yeah, there are a number of different companies working on them and different levels of technology  .   How was your experience with the robots on your university campus, though? Many places are testing them on university campuses, probably because there are a lot of pedestrian paths (and people ordering delivery)  .  
These have been going in MK for 4 years, and at various universities in America for about the same amount of time  .   As far as I can tell, nobody has reported stealing one! But then, what would you do with it? I suspect it's not worth much for parts  .  
what if someone is waiting for it to show they could wait in there car see it coming just be for it gets there walk up to your door and act like your walking out of your house when your not and snag your package and take off with it or what if your not home
Oh wow! We had a pilot program with these exact robots back in 2017  .   But now I think they are limited to just a few neighborhoods  .   I haven't seen one of these guys in a while  .   A college campus with limited traffic seems like a much better use case than a busy city  .  
These things are all over the place in MK  .   If you go to some local stores you will see them parked up outside, ready for action  .   Don't think you can get booze or smokes  .   Co-op, Tesco's and others  .   Guessing you were close to Kingston Tesco  .   Nice catch  .  
What happens if I Live so far away from the Amazon warehouse it just drives on the highways sidewalk Will it run out of battery Or you go near the House and Start making the robot to go to the house making the robot go over there And making sure the person gets it's package?
in these types of videos, I would want to know more what are the challenges and how different their approaches are  .   how are they addressing the difficult terrains and inaccurate GPS  .   Is their AI significantly better, did they train it differently? Thanks just some feedback, so much potential, yet feels empty
Hello, this is the starship company  .   We are sorry for the inconvenience to the people that did not get their food  .   We are not gonna refund you  .   We are gonna keep your food but we would like to say sorry for the inconvenience now go cry about it you little crybaby girl  .  
These have been a thing in MK for at least 5 years, maybe more  .   I would say they have been about longer than e scooters have, assuming you have noted those! Never used one myself but you do see them everywhere, all the time  .   They often park up outside M&S up the city xxx
they only deliver a few bags of shopping, mostly less value than you would have to spend at a minimum to get a people delivery  .   The robots are good for small quantity, immediate response, such as if you need a jar of pickles and you have COVID  .   I don't think they replace delivery drivers  .  
How is a scout more efficient then transporting bulk packages? If Amazon is processing millions of parcels per day are we to believe there will be a million of these bots on the street? I understand the concept and applaud the advancement of AI, but this doesn’t seem feasible as a mass market delivery solution  .  
Good point! I can't speak to the power reserve, but I can tell you that - in Mountain View - they used to be stored and charged in a grocery store in front of which they were usually parked in stand by during the day  .   So I am imagining you need a business to host them for the night  .  
It is only a matter of time before a company invents a model is designed to ID or mark thieves for 1) arrest in the case of adults, or 2) a note to mom and dad in the case of children, together with  a bill for costs  .   Robot drones delivering to secure parcel boxes can't be far off  .  
With the wheelie bins all over the pavements and cars parked on pavements etc. round here, your shop could end up being in an accident as it tries to either get past or ends up on the roads  .   Novel idea and who knows what the future holds but I think humans need reprogramming to keep the pavements clear for starters  .  
A more realistic approach would be utilizing these in places like nursing homes & hospitals  .   They could transport samples from the patient's bed direct to the lab autonomously, take bio-hazard waste to a safe space for immediate disposal, and deliver medications so they arrive at the same time medical staff arrive at the patient's room during medical staff round  .  
I guess we have had these Starship delivery things for about 2 years now  .   MK was a trial area for these electric scooters (the ones you hire)  .   Driverless cars are occasionally tested in the carparks from time to time, but the main testing place for them in Millbrook Proving ground  .  which is just south of MK close to Jnc 13 of the M1  .  
That's the point  .   We are not there yet, how else would the robot learn? In a lab? It has to go on real world sidewalks, with a people along to fix it when it gets stuck  .   That way they can learn and fix real world problems so one day the people doesn't have to be there
Of course I am much stricter, because robots are far less than people  .   They are just sensors and actuators and a motherboard somewhere  .   A walking notebook  .   Of course I can use force to keep your robot from doing what it wants on my property  .   And of course you should be made to pay for the public space you use  .  
Been in my for bout 3 years  .   Most of the city can order one from local shop  .   Starship the app but they run out of , one stops , Tesco, co-op , on special days they even sing a queen song or other music  .   Anything from £1 to £3 for delivery  .   No alcohol or cigarettes  .   But still cool
Sue Sort of: there is indirect pollution in terms of *where* the electricity comes from; and how well - or not - the manner of their old batteries are disposed of  .   This is less than an equivalent man & a delivery scooter or car would produce, but is still more than - for the sake of example - a man on a bicycle or on foot  .  
It's autonomous dumbo it has obstacle detection sensors, cameras, ultrasonic sensors, radar, neural networks, and other technology the robots can detect obstacles, including animals, pedestrians, cyclists, and other delivery robots  .   And it uses satellite imagery and generate a route from point A to B and identify the shortest and the safest path for him  .  
There are small delivery robots like this in Ohio State university  .   From what I have seen when they get stuck  .   they will ask for help and usually people push them  .   From other companies with similar project  .   they are planning a reward system  .   when you help the robot you get a discount on delivery stuff or what ever service they provide  .  
Space clearly you are not aware of the kiwibot  .   It was invented in south America where the CEO is from and he has people back at his university in Bolivia, driving the bot  .   the camera in front shows the person where to go and you need to wave at the person for them to open to the box for you  .   trust me bro  .  
Instead of being a delivery man, people should learn to be engineers so they could fix the robots  .   Making some jobs obsolete does not remove other jobs that need to be done  .   150 years ago 90% of people were farmers  .   Now it is less than 10% tractors made it happen, food still comes and farmers just found new jobs to apply their time to  .  
Actually not no one isn't driving a robot it's actually driving itself what ever you order on the phone you can tell the robot what location you won't to drop off, you can even walk to it and it will pass you, but also you can stop it by using your phone  .  its called technology buddy not everything has be running by people  .  
As I understand it, they go out with a minder and explore the area, building pavement route maps, and then those maps are refined by humans into go and don't go areas, and then they are completely AI driven unless they get stuck / lifted / etc. and a remote operator can take over  .   So mostly AI, but the occasional people if necessary!
So if I live in an apartment I have to get dressed, go downstairs, and outside where it may be cold or raining, and pickup  .   That’s not really delivery, would be acceptable only if it’s much cheaper  .   If it gets really popular will there be a crowd of 10-20 robots waiting on the sidewalk outside of every building  .  ?
Well if they are solar powered or run on a hydrogen fuel cell they could last year's without a AC power outlet  .   I can tell you are in the box and not thinking outside of it   .   Now they might run on batteries but what about in the future  .   If we all thought like you we would still be using calculators instead of smart phones  .   Lol
Cause just "stopping at close obstacles" would be quite basic  .   If you want to know how to correctly avoid a people you should first know that the "close obstacle" is a human, then predict the human's motion, and then plan your route  .   Otherwise you end up in that awkward situation where you both turn to the same side and laugh at each other
I will just wait and see how this turns out  .   But! That being said, from what I know flying drones would be a better option  .   Flying drones do not have as many obstacles as ground drones would  .   as for the CEOs concerns about (flying over kids in backyards) this can be avoided, by flying over roads, streets and highways traveling the same path as automobiles
The lady was correct they have been delivering for retailers like the Co op for years in Milton Keynes  .  Out side some of the shops you can see almost a dozen of them all lined up  .  You get an access code to open the box when it arrives with your shopping Throughout Milton Keynes there are what is called Red Ways, which are basically for pedestrians, bikes and the little Starship drones
Whatever, a hit’s a hit  .   Seeing as there was contact with her hands on the robot, that’s clearly visible, and that the girl rubs her knee after the impact, indicating contact was made enough for her to be hurt, I’d classify it as a hit  .   She didn’t magically dodge in the last second or phase through it  .  
I think all robots should have a license and remote i  .  d  .   to trace back to the pilot, person, or company who activates the mission  .   Then also Crack down and charge them with intervening in a crime scene in this case  .   But to be honest, just driving through such an area is nothing, can you imagine if it had illegal cargo, or explosives in it?
I live in a large US city  .   During the beginning of the pandemic we saw a few of these, similar not the same, crossing the street to a university dorm area as well as arriving and leaving a grocery store  .   I have got pictures of the little WALL-E fellas  .   Must have been a test period or a failure as I haven't seen them in a while  .  
That’s a whole damn train  .   You need hell tons of nerve to jump in to save a robot  .   Trust me It’s risky  .   At least that’s a robot and some food  .   Lifeless  .   What if someone, who have life, try to help it but get hit by a train instead? That’s not worth it  .   not at all  .  
It’s kind of on the store to design packaging, or adapt existing packaging to work during transit  .   The robots carry all kinds of things - groceries, medicine, hot and cold food containers of different sizes  .   What generally happens now is that coffee shops shrink wrap the takeaway cups so there’s little to no spillage  .   Also, Starship need to stop allowing their robots to yet up kerbs
Ever heard of innovation? It will get cheaper more durable and efficient as times goes by, by end of this decade it will be every where including drone delivery self driving vehicles, convenient stores and fast food with sensors everywhere where they will only employ one person while ai and bots run everything  .   Lots of big companies are using covid as excuse to fire people so they implement more automation  .  
I tend to disagree on this one  .   What does the mean of transportation have to do with the quality of what you order? Does the type of Door Dasher or Uber driver you get assigned to your delivery change the way the food is prepared or taste? Of course assuming this "toy" doesn't take way longer than a people to bring you the food, making it stale or cold  .  
I take it that Milton Keynes is all perfectly flat and free of any steep hills and big flights of steps etc.  .   like we have here in the north of England  .   And I can't help noticing in this video how the robots are all operating on nice smooth and level pavements, so is Milton Keynes more like somewhere in the Netherlands where it's nearly all flat like a snooker board?
I guess all of society around the world will get used to robots eventually and not trying to steal anything from them or destroy them Just for kicks, just for fun and to be assholes  .   For right now I can't see these robots roaming around the ghetto, down Martin Luther King Drive somewhere  .   The mentality of the people right now in ghetto areas just isn't up to par with this technology
I was working opposite the Threatre in the center MK, and one of them cam past and I had the same reaction as you, never seen such a thing apparently they have been operating for over 8 years  .   If you shand in front of it, it will ask you to move out of the way  .   The one I saw was delivering takeaway to an office block delivering lunch it even went through the underpass
I understand but it would only issue a shock if it detects itself being picked up off the ground by somebody other than a person meant to do maintenance on it  .   In this case, children and animals would not be harmed because they can't pick the robot up  .   I see where you are coming from though  .   I just think it would be funny to see a robot like this fight back and win  .  
heh, they do a bit! The ones in Bedford have only been here a few weeks, so the routes are still a bit rough  .   Over time the robots build up pathing data for all of the pavements and then people operatives can refine the routes so they stop falling off pavements / stop wandering about, etc.  .   They have been over in Milton Keynes for several years, so I would expect them to be pretty good over there now
This is my city  .   I’m here because I want to know what it’s all about  .   This was science fiction when I was a kid  .   I don’t know how I feel about a robot Taking a humans job though  .   I feel like it’s just a matter of time before Alexa is a humanoid walking around my house cleaning and doing dishes and asking me if she can hang my coat up for me  .  
It's not exactly clickbait just because it's not what *you* expected  .   They start in one place, get loaded, go somewhere and get unloaded  .   Go pick up a box, walk down the street and deliver it to your friend's house, that's what they do all day  .   Video shows them being loaded and unloaded, going out and about, I agree it's a little disjointed in places but you seem unnecessarily angry about it lol
Ok fair point  .   You can do more with the decision making  .   But in this video it just looks like obstacle avoidance  .   But you can do more than "stopping at close obstacles" with spatial information about obstacles ;) That's simple trajectory planning in your local space  .   It's getting more interesting when you see a car coming out of an exit and the robot's state machine decides whether it waits even though it would have the right of way on the sidewalk  .  
i am just gonna climb into the robot when it stops and see where it takes me just use a magnet to fool the door sensor into thinking i closed it I know the robot is strong enough to carry me i have built robots way smaller than that that can carry a grown man sitting on them it probably has a weight sensor and it's probably gonna refuse to go anywhere if there's something heavier than say somebody's lunch inside but i can dream
Same thing as with rentable scooters, yes they might get vandalized sometimes or get run over by a car or whatnot, but it's rare enough that the attrition rate is acceptable  .   Most people actually don't care to fuck with a robot that is just doing it's own thing no more than they care to fuck with some random parked car  .   Never mind that the robot has a lot more security cameras on it and alarms back to home base in case of trouble  .  
don't listen to these guys, your question is a valid one and it just shows you don't let yourself get irrational by hype  .   However, in this case I think the purpose of the chaperone is that of a bug detector  .   with some people observation, they can take notes on what it's doing wrong and the difficulties it faces so that they can later update the software it runs on and eventually clear out any issues so it can one day run fully autonomously
I saw Yogi Steve from Electric Scooter Academy pass by one of these things  .   And I never even knew this/these existed  .   How do they work? program designed? Is someone following it is a remote control is there a video I can find a see how these work? I’ve seen the remote computerized floor cleaners at Walmart but this thing is weird  .   Are machine gun’s gonna pop out of it and start shooting if someone tries to steal the food ha ha ha
That`s why in Germany (where they operate as well), each delivery robot is accompanied by a companion which walks in some distance from it and is there to solve "situations" (like righting the robot up again, if some asshole has toppled it)  .   Of course this system also means that the robots don't exactly replace the people delivery boys (or girls)   .   they just have different jobs now (i  .  e  .   keeping care of "their" robot while it delivers instead of directly delivering the bought goods)
I was waiting to see what happened when you, um, "courageously?" gave it the "go" command while standing right by it  .   "Didn't run over your feet" - haha  .   I was wondering if it would take out your knee! If memory serves me correctly college was [sometimes devastatingly] pranksters  .   Poor robot must be thinking, "why a college campus? Don't you care about what humiliating thing they will come up with to do to me?!"
It's a great question  .   Some of the ways that delivery robot companies are addressing this are having the compartment locked until the customer unlocks it with their mobile app, and having cameras--and people--that are monitoring for theft or vandalism  .   It may also help that the devices at the moment just deliver food, so the hassle and risk of stealing and destroying one to get a free burrito (almost certainly cold by then  .  ) may simply not be worth it  .   Time will tell, though!

I am a pizza delivery driver in Utah, and let me tell you that this is the future  .   Literally last night, on a Friday evening, we only had TWO delivery drivers on the clock  .   Short-staffed is the new norm, and customers hate it because the food is always late  .   Anyhow, so delivery robots are a must to fill that gap  .   And while this little fella can't do long distance deliveries like I can, autonomous vehicles can, and companies like Domino's are currently working on it  .  
Because the robot car can't cause much damage if it gets in the way of a car that doesn't avoid it  .   But if a car avoids the out of control robot car, then swerves into a bus stop which has people waiting at it - who then is the one at fault? The software programmer, the company that made the unreliable robot car, the company using the robot car, or the driver of the car the took avoiding action  .   Interesting philosophical point  .   I know who they authorities will blame - the driver  .  
If the driver can hit that it could have easily hit a child walking in front of their parents, or a baby buggy pushed by someone  .   it is why it has brightly colored flag  .   Having said that children get hit that way as the driver has a message blind spot coming off a drive  .   It's on of those where no matter how prepared either are the robot can't just like anyone predict every single even and humans aren't superhero's that can see through things  .   Don't think anyone is truly to blame here  .  
in the few vids I have seen where people interact with the bots, such as a child that was walking alongside it, the machine kept stopping, as though analyzing if the person was in their way, etc.  .   Now if an operator was running it remotely and could see the little girl, why would they, the operator, stop the bot so often - aside of wishing to entertain and fascinate the child? It looked as though the machine was fully automated  .   The vids were recent and filmed in Milton Keynes, UK  .   Thanks  .  
Glad to see it got through unmolested, nothing worse than cold pizza  .   It's laughable commenters saying "what if there's a bomb in it?" or "what if it's transporting drugs?" Well of course a parked car, van or truck would better suited for bombs and again a car or van is considerably less conspicuous for transporting contraband that a tiny self-driving robot  .   But we are talking sense and a lot of people don't seen to have any or ignore the most reasonable thing and prefer to be frightened of nothing  .  
I think it would be beneficial if, whenever a tech company had any sort of AI/robotic solution or convenience, they should be obligated to have at the very least TWO veteran civil engineers to refine and 'naysay' their ideas, forcing them to refine their initial iterations  .   So many times there are messy roll-outs or entirely unnecessary designs put into action without proper external input  .   I am incredibly PRO-tech, but only with the Asterisk of Responsible Tech  .   Ps  .   We really do not need facial scanning  .   The improvements will NEVER outstrip the detriments facial recognition will cause  .  
I have seen some videos outside the campus, starships roaming on roads for home delivery  .   some times it is giving a quick start or stop, like getting down and climbing on a footpath to cross the road, rushing after avoiding an obstacle, etc.  .  !  .   isn't it gonna spill beverages that are loosely packed? and if a bad person takes advantage of it and what if he placed an explosive and it was a bomb to be precise in its return journey, how is it gonna handle it?  .   will it halt? will it complain? or something?
They target dense population areas first and then tackle the next thing  .   I have seen some security bots at malls and while I am curious what it does when you tackle it what it does but am not so curious that I do it to find out  .   I must say that if I was younger I absolutely would be  .   Automating something well takes a tremendous amount of initial effort but theoretically pays off in the end  .   But if it creates more problems than it fixes it will be rejected at least for awhile longer
I think they should try to sell some of these to companies with large campuses starting off  .   It could fetch food from the cafeteria, deliver prototypes from shop to engineer, retrieve parts from warehouses, etc.  .   Imagine it bringing a change of shirt when you spill shit on you like an idiot, but you can't leave because you are busy, even though you have a meeting with a client in an hour and a half  .   Yeah, this would be perfect for a large office building or park  .   You wouldn't even have to worry about sidewalk laws because they are all privately owned  .  
My biggest question is; what protects them from theft and tampering? Say a group of kids decide to roll one over or jam it in somewhere, or someone decides to catch one and break it open or take the wheels off? Brilliant idea, but people can be so ungrateful, inconsiderate and just generally awful that it's only a matter of time before they are targeted  .   I saw one once before when I was visiting family and I am just outside one of the new areas, but I am pretty sure they wouldn't survive 5 minutes back in my hometown before being thrown in the pond or set on fire  .  
Interesting service, but is it really "contactless" if you have to open the lid with your hands? And how many other people have opened the lid before you have? Or how many people have touched the robot whilst travelling? What if one of those people are self-isolating cos they have covid, they just spread it to your robot and anyone else who may tough it  .   Would be better if the lid opened itself when instructed by the app, and closes itself when you click send back  .   Maybe even some vapor/windscreen jets to spray 70% IPA over the lid before delivery, camera checking to make sure no one accidentally gets squirted on or into their eyes etc.
I wouldn't say those robots are "smarter than a tesla"  .   Self driving cars like Tesla's have to deal with roads being broken, with no lines painted, and has to be extremely adaptable and unbelievably reliable  .   These food delivery robots don't exactly have to deal with that  .   But I still get the point though  .   Because they operate on sidewalks and aren't 2 ton cars on the freeway, they can work with much more autonomy than normal  .   The real problem though is getting these bots to work on neighborhoods without proper sidewalks  .   The company is gonna be pretty limited on what areas they can actually service  .   Obviously for cities, this would be really beneficial  .   But the real challenge is expanding to suburbs  .  
I was just wondering that  .   A wheelchair, or another 'Scout', either from Amazon or another company doing robot deliveries  .   I guess it could pull off in a yard to let them pass, but you just KNOW that people would immediately start filing lawsuits claiming damage to their lawns, or emotional suffering to their dogs; anything for a quick payout  .   And that's not even considering the people who will intentionally 'trip' and sprawl all over the things, and then claim it ran them down (like you see in those Russian dashcam videos)  .   The bots will have to have really good 360 degree video recording running at all times to refute that kind of thing, as well as a comm link to the local cops so they can respond if there's vandalism or theft of the bot  .  
An important thing to note is that these robots and the technology required to make them end up doing a few things for people jobs  .   1  .   Baseline, it creates jobs  .   These are new industries and emergent technologies that require humans to engineer, manufacture, and program these robots to do this kind of work  .   2  .   As the creator stated, these robots are meant to optimize the people Dashers' job by letting them take the deliveries that pay them more as a result  .   Dashers often don't want to take the short 2-3 minute jobs because the pay is low, and the travel required on both ends to and from the delivery is actually costing them more than if they took a longer delivery  .   Also if you really want to use the robot jobs vs humans analogy, then you should be similarly upset at places like car manufacturing plants, where robots have taken people "jobs" for decades now (but that industry has not suffered as a result, nor have the types of jobs that only humans can do have changed and evolved over time)  .   jimmy
Ah but that opens up a whole other can of worms  .   You see, my right of way must never be blocked and a robot must never make physical contact with me or otherwise fire a projectile or emit anything that is injurious to me  .   That rules out pretty much every conceivable active countermeasure a robot might have, such as tasers, chemical sprays, high-decibel siren etc.  .   Because even when I am not the attacker, I could be a bystander who is affected  .   But also because your robot might not be welcome on my property and I am expediting its departure  .   What if I am hurt by your robot just because I am kicking it and shoving it out of my door? I think a lot of thought still has to go into this entire business of mixing humans with robots  .   people safety is only the tip of the iceberg, there are many other issues as well  .   Such as how you will pay for the public space your robot or robots use? What insurances shall we require you to carry  .   What annual certifications will we require? Will you need an operator license?
Well you have to put the bins on the pavement or they just won't empty them and people don't work 9to5 anymore so they may get left out a few days  .   It's the same for cars if they stop them going on the pavement which we all know is not ideal then they will just park on the road   .   Now that is legal but they leave room for wagons and buses to get past by parking on the pavement a bit  .   So it's a choice, No buses and nothing being delivered that can not fit in a small van , spending taxes for better parking spots ,or park on the pavement  .   People would also soon complain when they never saw a bus stop for 5 mile's  .  I don't need to park on the pavement as my road is big enough but if others did not then bin wagons could not empty bins , emergency services could not fit down streets and nobody could get any materials for building work also many cars would just have to sit waiting for a gap adding hours to a week's travel and massive pollution and costs   .  Easy to complain but there is not a solution something has to get blocked   .  
I am curious about that too  .   I envision a multi-faceted approach  .   Probably can't just be one thing  .   Sidewalk robots, flying drones, ziplines, and tubes or tunnels are all possibilities  .   Currently, the concern I have with the sidewalk robots is that they are probably only good for close-proximity delivery  .   If it is too far away it would take extra long to deliver and people aren't gonna go for that  .   And if the location is walking distance from the home, then maybe, just maybe, the people should walk there anyway and pick it up! I know that's not always practical, but I am thinking, if the robot was at the corner store near my apartment and I wanted some food from there, I would just prefer to walk there and get it  .   If I order delivery it is often when I am already out driving, on my way home, and I pick something up on my way  .   If I am already at home and the place I want delivery from is a good distance away, that's where a better method of fast-delivery would be welcomed  .   I think we also need sustainable delivery and return systems  .   That means, some standardization of containers so that when we get the product out of the box/container, we can put it back and it can be used by a variety of stores instead of just one 'brand'  .   Still don't know the quite, right mix, but I am open to suggestion  .  
So cute! But this is a real business  .   95% of the time there will be NO customer ready to pop out and greet the bot at the moment of delivery  .   The FedEx Bot is the clear winner from my perspective  .   It has superior navigation skills, which are the hardest and most expensive piece for any bot  .   A SUPER requirement for delivering large/heavy boxes right up to someone's front door  .   A suitable bot must be able to navigate any and all kinds of surface terrain (dirt, small stones, crushed seashells) in any weather (rain/snow/ice) walking on possibly unclear paths and coming up against objects such as toys, landscaping bushes, flowers, deciding whether to try to clear the path or go around an object, then finally make its way down or up stairways/stairwells, irregular stone stairs, steep steps made of everything from slippery composite boards, to old/cracked/broken wood/concrete material, and position itself right up to that front or side door to drop the package in a manner that is safe  .   Small details such as whether the front door opens IN or opens OUT will determine whether any portion of the package can be left in the path of an OUTWARD swinging front door  .   The most common front door consists of a large cement set of 2 or 3 steps where the cement stairs is usually only a few inched wider than the door itself, making it dangerous or impossible to leave most large and/or heavy packages on the top landing of the front door cement steps IF the outermost front door opens OUTWARD, because it would hit the package and either push it off the stairs flying (if lightweight), or prevent the customer from coming out the front door to retrieve their package (if package is heavy)  .
