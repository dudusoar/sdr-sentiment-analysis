Sample Comments:
  Sample 1: Some of these people could be a little slimmer if they walked to the shops.
  Sample 2: It's illegal to drive on the sidewalk!
  Sample 3: no inmigrants
  Sample 4: This technology will burn itself out - once they catch on there will be too many of them for the pavement and the novelty will ware off. There will be campaign groups to ban them, as they will be seen as a danger to pedestrians. Then they will then be banished to the road where they will cause congestion and a danger to road users.
  Sample 5: After the 1st 100 units have been kicked into the Thames or vandalized, the pizza shops are going to think twice about this.
