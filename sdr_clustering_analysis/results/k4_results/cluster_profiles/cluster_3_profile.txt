  Sample 1: Do you like the convenience of food delivery but hate that it gets to you fast, hot, and fresh?
  Sample 2: We're losing face to face communication with all these advances in technology
  Sample 3: Count the hours until your job is completely replaced by AI. I'm sure the company is constantly thinking of that eventuality.
  Sample 4: Been in mk for bout 3 years. Most of the city can order one from local shop. Starship the app but they run out of , one stops , tesco, co,op , on special days they even sing a queen song or other music. Anything from £1 to £3 for delivery. No alcohol or cigarettes. But still cool
