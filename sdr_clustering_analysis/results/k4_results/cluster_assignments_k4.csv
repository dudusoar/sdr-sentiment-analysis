3645,"In my area, the vast majority of fast food deliveries are done by bike, some by electric bikes or electric scooters. These robots would, therefore, achieve one thing, unemployment. They also need to travel more slowly than a human on a bike, so food would not be as warm when it arrived. Some have commented on using these to deliver packages. Is it really a good idea to replace 1 driver in 1 car, who can be making 20 to 30 deliveries, with a greater number of these? I have my groceries delivered, the van drivers tell me that they make 8 to 10 deliveries per trip, and during a day will do 4 or 5 trips. These robots would need to be larger, divided into compartments with a chilled section and a frozen section, and a large number of units would be required to fulfil current demand. Even if roadways could, eventually, be reclaimed to provide more space for pedestrians, there would not be enough space for robots and people, especially as reclaimed roadways usually include space for bikes. There are many issues raised by this type of system: •Rural areas are not catered for. •In a CBD or an urban area with high rise accommodation, how do the robots access upper floors? If they don't, then it defeats the whole concept of deliveries, which are meant to be door to door. •People living in rougher areas would be unlikely to be served by these robots, as companies, like many taxi drivers now, would be unwilling to enter areas of risk. •If the robot stops for people, which they should, how, in a busy area, do they get anywhere without being stationary for half a trip.

3862,"Is this the future? Possibly. Is it worth it? I don’t think so. While we have UberEats and other food delivery services available, they aren’t really great. Mainly because of the human aspect of the delivery. 1) Delivery staff can take the money and call it a day while the customer gets nothing. The service may terminate the staff for failure to comply and theft. 2) Delivery order can be ridiculously small and not worth the trip like that order of Starbucks. Not saying for this device but for the delivery service that uses people. The driver can just simply decline. The order and it may be handed to another driver who may pick it up, ultimately forcing a driver to make the trip and delivering the small order that probably took a large portion of the profit for gas. 3) These delivery services are paid poorly. One might be fortunate to get a tip (if that’s how most services work) but I believe they just get a small delivery payment and the rest goes to the service which is really the sad part of these services. I believe that this will eventually replace human delivery drivers for those kinds of services as they are kind of better. Small, rechargeable, they look sturdy and are aware of their surroundings.

Just like the deer who is easily picked off by hunters in tree-stands, so to will pedestrians often stumble over a rolling beer cooler trying to navigate itself through a heavily walked intersection, with no eye-height flag. Which ever company is found to be best at meeting such human needs, will be found to be the most ""needed"" company.

81,"An important thing to note is that these robots and the technology required to make them end up doing a few things for human jobs. 1. Baseline, it creates jobs. These are new industries and emergent technologies that require humans to engineer, manufacture, and program these robots to do this kind of work. 2. As the creator stated, these robots are meant to optimize the human Dashers' job by letting them take the deliveries that pay them more as a result. Dashers often don't want to take the short 2-3 minute jobs because the pay is low, and the travel required on both ends to and from the delivery is actually costing them more than if they took a longer delivery. Also if you really want to use the robot jobs vs humans analogy, then you should be similarly upset at places like car manufacturing plants, where robots have taken human ""jobs"" for decades now (but that industry has not suffered as a result, nor have the types of jobs that only humans can do have changed and evolved over time). jimmy",1,2.0

3117,"So cute! But this is a real business. 95% of the time there will be NO customer ready to pop out and greet the bot at the moment of delivery. The FedEx Bot is the clear winner from my perspective. It has superior navigation skills, which are the hardest and most expensive piece for any bot. A SUPER requirement for delivering large/heavy boxes right up to someone's front door. A suitable bot must be able to navigate any and all kinds of surface terrain (dirt, small stones, crushed seashells) in any weather (rain/snow/ice) walking on possibly unclear paths and coming up against objects such as toys, landscaping bushes, flowers, deciding whether to try to clear the path or go around an object, then finally make its way down or up stairways/stairwells, irregular stone stairs, steep steps made of everything from slippery composite boards, to old/cracked/broken wood/concrete material, and position itself right up to that front or side door to drop the package in a manner that is safe. Small details such as whether the front door opens IN or opens OUT will determine whether any portion of the package can be left in the path of an OUTWARD swinging front door. The most common front door consists of a large cement set of 2 or 3 steps where the cement stairs is usually only a few inched wider than the door itself, making it dangerous or impossible to leave most large and/or heavy packages on the top landing of the front door cement steps IF the outermost front door opens OUTWARD, because it would hit the package and either push it off the stairs flying (if lightweight), or prevent the customer from coming out the front door to retreive their package (if package is heavy).",1,2.0

3792,"Ah but that opens up a whole other can of worms. You see, my right of way must never be blocked and a robot must never make physical contact with me or otherwise fire a projectile or emit anything that is injurious to me. That rules out pretty much every conceivable active countermeasure a robot might have, such as tasers, chemical sprays, high-decibel siren etc. Because even when I'm not the attacker, I could be a bystander who is affected. But also because your robot might not be welcome on my property and I'm expediting its departure. What if I'm hurt by your robot just because I am kicking it and shoving it out of my door?

3822,"I'm curious about that too. I envision a multi-faceted approach. Probably can't just be one thing. Sidewalk robots, flying drones, ziplines, and tubes or tunnels are all possibilities. Currently, the concern I have with the sidewalk robots is that they are probably only good for close-proximity delivery. If it is too far away it would take extra long to deliver and people aren't going to go for that. And if the location is walking distance from the home, then maybe, just maybe, the people should walk there anyway and pick it up! I know that's not always practical, but I'm thinking, if the robot was at the corner store near my apartment and I wanted some food from there, I would just prefer to walk there and get it. If I order delivery it is often when I'm already out driving, on my way home, and I pick something up on my way. If I'm already at home and the place I want delivery from is a good distance away, that's where a better method of fast-delivery would be welcomed. I think we also need sustainable delivery and return systems. That means, some standardization of containers so that when we get the product out of the box/container, we can put it back and it can be used by a variety of stores instead of just one 'brand'.

Now that is legal but they leave room for wagons and buses to get past by parking on the pavement a bit.

People would also soon complain when they never saw a bus stop for 5 mile's.I don't need to park on the pavement as my road is big enough but if others did not then bin wagons could not empty bins , emergency services could not fit down streets and nobody could get any materials for building work also many cars would just have to sit waiting for a gap adding hours to a week's travel and massive pollution and costs .Easy to complain but there is not a solution something has to get blocked .",3,2.0

I mean here in the late night given that I'm in Ohio the questions do run pretty deep about things via the world we do live in and where it's headed and I will say that yeah on one hand there seems to be a huge push for automation except I can also see where we're still a decent ways out from this the bad part is essentially everybody has been more so groomed over the past 22 plus years to set it home and point and click their way through a shopping adventure on a computer or of course here in the past 10 years a cell phone! It is like they're trying to limit if not demolish our human interactions! Of course there's numerous channels etc that's talked about the whole automation arrangement over the years and oh I believe it could definitely happen I mean in fact I can tell you that most industry has had the capability of automation since the mid to late 1950s it's just it's like those years they must have had a gentleman's agreement with the politicians I guess they didn't know what to do with us! Of course to those who say that well I mean if they automated all the stuff we would all be out of work immediately blah blah blah for a long time I have said Yes actually it would have a profound effect that you would definitely have to figure out something else to do but it wouldn't be the first time that's happened... About a hundred years ago there used to be a group of people and every town that would go out and light the lamps in fact they were called lamp lighters! It was a real job they would go out just as a son was going down about dusk or a little before dusk and they would go around and light the street lamps as they ran on gas some of which ran on kerosene or whale oil... The bottom line is is of course electricity became a thing so the lamp lighters lost their jobs of course you could probably talk about how a lot of them particularly those on the younger side of the profession immediately got a job with the electric company perhaps what changing bulbs and street lights! So they did lose the job and a profession was lost but then a new profession came along! Of course these automated cards does bring up one thing and that is simply you have services like instacart doordash etc I mean that's going to cause people to lose their jobs and what's interesting is currently those are alternative jobs so where the hell are people going to go after that what are they going to come up with next I really wonder! Of course the thing is is you know outside of the big cities particularly here in the Midwest I mean a lot of our towns and cities aren't set up for those automated carts to run you know we don't really have the sidewalks in many areas we don't really have the infrastructure as in the traffic isn't controlled the same way as it would be in Los Angeles we don't have that much concrete going around so how would they then plot for these things to to function I mean yeah they're technically thinking outside the box but to a degree they're not really thinking outside of Los Angeles! And then of course it does beg the question are they really automated and the fullest of senses or does somebody back at a headquarters have remote control in case something goes wrong with GPS then they can guide the damn thing where it needs to go so just how much automation are we really talking?",3,3.0

The risks for simple willful damage to the robots is too great and too easy unless they had a self defense mechanism built in like an electronic tazer:). They could be victimized by any number of assailants such as simple practical jokers, competitive saboteurs, anti robot activists, run of the mill thieves and vandals etc. Even though they would be monitored by head office, the attackers would be gone in a matter of minutes. The easiest attack would be to simply throw one like a moped, into a pickup truck and into a Faraday non traceable bag. Vandals could simply throw a heavy sticky, ruglike material onto the robot, or pour some liquid like oil or cement onto the wheel mechanism. Other ways could be to smash them with some type of ramming object or vehicle or spray paint the camera lenses and sensors. Or the contents themselves could be rendered undeliverable by spraying the whole unit with some noxious skunk like smell and then derailing the whole public's trust in them.

With no minimum wage, the pay for automatable jobs would crash until it gets to 50 cents per hour. There's no easy way out of this, it doesn't matter if the minimum wage is 15 or 12 dollars. This comment is extremely ignorant.",3,3.0
6704,"They have been saying that, and it's fairly accurate. Read my comments above. It's why so much of the workforce has moved to service rather than manufacturing.

2929,"no its not a load of rubbish about the shortage of drivers at all... Its fact! Whether someone doesn't want to drive because of poor pay or long hours is completely irrelevant. The fact still remains that there is a shortage regardless of the reason. It makes no difference if you are or were a lorry driver, if you don't want to do it any more then you no longer are one. We are 100,000 drivers short in the UK alone fact so you moaning to me for listening to the media is just rubbish. Where else am i going to get the news from ""truckers digest"" . And going on about how drivers can make 50k a year but by doing 60 hours a week means nothing to me as my last job was 60+ hours a week for only 30k... Irrelevant point! My original points were that A) there is a shortage of drivers (regardless of why) and B) British people just don't want to do the work, same as fruit picking etc. So what do we have to do, rely on bringing in foreign workers because without them our country will be screwed.",3,888.0
2930,"Isn’t it ironic that now truck drivers are in short supply that everyone is falling over themselves to try and make our life better, Why ! Because it’s affecting the general public’s way of life, Well here’s some of the reasons why you the public can’t get your precious McDonald’s milk shake or your favourite bottle of beer from the Supermarket, For decades the majority of hauliers have suppressed the wages of drivers, expecting a 60 to 70 hour working week for a take home pay of around the £500 to £600 mark, For decades the well-being of most drivers have never been taking into consideration, asking for the simple things like a fridge or even a night heater in the truck would result in the company saying, Well if you don’t like it you know where the door is, we can soon replace you, Most hauliers ( not all ) still expect us to do 3 x 15 hours days on the trot with a measly 9 hours off, that’s 45 hours of work in 3 days and yes it’s legal for us to do that, That’s more than you the general public do all week, Fancy a bit if that do you ? I think not, Asking to get home for a reason would often result in them giving you an impossible task on that day, A lot of hauliers even to this day won’t pay for overnight parking in a truck stop or a Motorway Services because of the cost of parking that’s in the region of £20 to £40 a night that’s why we have to park in a lay-by or an industrial estate with no facilities for the driver for 9 to 11 hours so when you the general public unfortunately stumble across a driver having a piss, don’t knock him for doing a natural bodily function that you can do in the comfort of your home, As for delivering / collecting from customers, A lot of the time we are late, not our fault most of the time but we get the flack so we feel that we have to go cap in hand to try and get tipped but often met with YOUR LATE ! you’ll have to wait until we can fit you in or you’ll have to get it re-booked, Well sorry old pal but you should be fucking grateful that you’ve actually got your stuff here, not give us attitude because we have upset your 8 hour shift routine, As for actually driving a 44 tonne truck, Why oh why nowadays do you the car driver on a 70 mph road with good driving conditions sit there at 50 to 55 mph getting tangled up with us trucks that are limited to 56 mph You shouldn’t be anywhere near us, we shouldn’t be catching you up like we seem to nowadays, We shouldn’t be put in a situation to have to overtake you, you shouldn’t be anywhere to be seen, so when you sit behind us in the overtaking lane, annoyed because I’m holding you up the chances are that I’m overtaking a twat in a car who think the A64 is a country lane to bumble along on, so swear at him not us, Overall this is just the tip of the iceberg of what’s wrong with this haulage industry, I could go on forever with what needs changing, Why do I still do it ? Because it’s in my blood, it’s a part of my life, I still have passion for the job that’s why, but rest assured it’s going to get worse as the average age of a truck driver is 55 years old now and rising, I personally don’t think this is a Brexit thing, this is all down to decades of suppression of the HGV driver by the hauliers, basically treating us like shit, You the hauliers have put yourselves in this situation and I’m glad to see that it’s come back to bite you lot on the arse.",3,888.0
2931,Owen I’m a lorry driver myself and I can quite clearly see your listening to the media. It is a load of rubbish about the shortage of drivers.. the truth is there is a shortage of drivers that are willing to drive for rubbish money. There’s a shortage of company’s willing to pay a decent wage and are more interested in the profit.. where do you think the higher wages are coming from now? It’s not because companies can’t afford it. £12 an hour to drive and have the responsibility of a 44ton truck? All your driving times are highly regulated often with numerous rules contradicting each other. Anything that could possibly go wrong is the drivers fault and the driver will be held accountable. Who would want that for such rubbish money? You may also see on the news ‘truck drivers earn really good money’. Yes we earn £40-50k a year but the amount and the irregular hours(often 3-4am starts) we work makes that wage a pittance. Truck drivers are expected to work on average 60hours a week + nights out (away from family and friends) at the same time the ‘planners’ in the office are work 9am-5pm earn the same money as us and have a company car.. what would you rather do? Have a job with a late start time and reasonable finish time? Or a job which has really early starts and no finish time.. treated and spoken to like rubbish from planers same at your delivery/collection points.. public in cars causing havoc which can make the difference of you getting home or not.. sitting at deliveries for 6 hours for no reason.. sitting on the docks waiting for your container for 3 hours.. what would you rather do? Drivers have been on the same wage for over 15years at the same time other careers the wages have doubled. Drivers ask for a pay rise and all that gets said is if drivers get a pay rise the cost of everything will go up for everyone.. do you hear lorry drivers complaining that the gas engineer has had a pay rise so we have to pay more for our gas servicing? No you don’t. To tell someone to wise up is hardly attacking someone it’s a fact. Maybe you should stop worrying about your McDonald’s milkshake and find out the truth and see what’s happening for yourself rather than listening to the rubbish the media and the rich hauliers are telling you.,3,888.0
2932,"just by looking at the current driver crisis in the UK right now your point is simply invalid. People don't want to drive lorries hence why the UK has a 100,000 driver shortage.

Inflation has been out of control since the 70's regardless of the party in charge, and there's really no solution to it. The problem continues to be the middle class and poor pay all of the taxes, and the rich make 100x their average employee and pay little to no taxes.

It needs absolutely stamping out everywhere! There was none of that insane nonsense back in the 80's, you could listen to just about any soundtrack or music back then and enjoy it, but then in 1990 the maniacal click routine suddenly became an absolute OBSESSION and since then it has only become even MORE of an obsession which we absolutely DON'T need, it's NOT even remotely relaxing, it's only a constant mechanised BRUTAL ASSAULT which only violently ENRAGES anyone severely disabled like ME with far more severe MISOPHONIA and the sooner that fact is FAR more well known, and properly and officially recognised the BETTER!",2,888.0

I can't say on here what I really think as it would most likely get me arrested.

674,"There are more reasons to buy Papa Johns stock than ever now: 1. Papa Johns is targetting insiders for automation which are the hardest to staff and easiest to replace 2. People who don't like call centers and robots from Pizza Hut and Dominoes make up 10% of Papa Johns Sales 3. Nearly 100% of customers routinely claim they will not order from a store that does not physically up to the door. Many live in dorms, hotel rooms condos, apartments, and other robot unfriendly places 4. As a P/T weekend driver, I know that I use my phone to contact someone who is unreachable by any other mechanism 33% - 50% of the time out of 20-30 deliveries a night 5. As that driver. 15% of my deliveries involve improper addresses. Another 5% might involve other creative means to reach the customer 6. Another (very little intersection here) 5-10% of customers want to complain if things are not 100% correct and want a solution to that problem even if they did not create the issue 7. Driving at the speed required to make a delivery requires bending rules (not breaking them) and getting a little creative with routes. As a data architect/developer/programmer with quite a few CS courses under my belt, I know humans can and will for some time outperform robots in this aspect. Pizza Hut royally messed up customers with 30 minutes or less and actually got people killed (they lost a lawsuit over it). It takes 20 minutes to get your order out. 8. Papa Johns will probably not replace drivers anytime soon as it tends to be a laggard technologically Essentially, people are willing to pay a premium for 2-7 (tips average about $3.50 per delivery in my area and trend from $2-$4 in every area). However, if they don't get 2-7 they leave for somewhere else. A store that refuses them even in part tends to lose up to 40% of sales within 6-8 mths. Even if your customer service drops slightly, you lose 30% of your sales. Wrong industry for this sort of automation. Now, there is also a reason to buy FedEx and Walmart stock. Who cares how a package is delivered as long as it is intact and timely enough. FedEx, UPS, and long haul anything are about to croak.

3713,"Car food delivery can’t be profitable with a human driving or a 2000 pound plus vehicle, even if it is autonomous, to carry a sandwich. It’s too much labor and energy for too little product. The food delivery companies all loose money. Eventually they have to switch to light silly delivery vehicles before investors get tired of pouring money into companies that have no way to make money.",3,999.0
3716,"It's self-driving at level 4 that solves it, not this particular implementation. The point is that once you have safe operation at level 4, able to run reliably and hands-off within a predefined zone - and that's not far off, since there are plenty of examples of such services achieving deployments - changing the form factor of the vehicle is a small detail that just means retraining it to follow rules appropriate to its size and type of cargo. If you can run a delivery robot, you can run a robobike; if you can run a robotaxi, you can run a robobus. If you can run a robobus, you can run a robotruck. And they can get the cost down with economics of scale, making it cheaper to rent than to buy these vehicles; at minimum you'll be able to access exactly the capacity you need, rather than buying and maintaining for your peak load(which leads to roads filled with one passenger in a car that seats four or six). In lower density you'll have more single-seat options, in dense areas, more buses. So it is not just delivery but all road traffic that shifts towards shared on-demand fleets in an instant, just like how smartphones suddenly took off after the iPhone. In effect, everyone in the future is a transit user, save a few folks who either want a luxury vehicle or are too rural to be part of the networks. And then the consequences go on from there; a shrinking need for parking, easier point-to-point services shifting optimal sites for commercial construction, and so on.",3,999.0

Also in most cities, when you are 16 years old, you can pick an elektric bike off the street and pay with your card (it's build in the electric bike.) Most cities here are working on making their roads, bike or pedestrian friendly. In most cities you have to ride 30km in the centrum of the city. The Belgium government heavily advices to take public transport. But it's actually really shitty here . They also have electric cars for people in the cities to use with the same function.

3206,"Meet the autonomous delivery robots which are shaping the future of food delivery. Starship A six-wheeled ground drone from Starship Technologies. Equipped with a sensor suite that includes cameras, GPS and inertial measurement units, the robot can deliver items within a 6km radius. It has a large compartment to hold deliveries equivalent to the size of two grocery bags with a maximum weight of 10kg. Once the robot has arrived at the customer, the compartment is opened using a unique code generated after placing the order from a smartphone app. In March 2017, Dominos entered into a partnership with Starship Technologies to use the latter's robots as ""personal delivery devices"" The company plans to distribute thousands of robots across campuses around the world by 2019. Kiwi Kiwi is an autonomous delivery robot that picks up and delivers food and personal-care items within a roughly 1.6 square kilometers area centered around campus. The robot uses Deep Learning to correctly interpret data gathered from its sensors and to make intelligent decisions that ensure a fast, safe and cost-efficient delivery. It can correctly identify traffic lights in order to cross streets and detect objects and obstacles to avoid collisions in a safe, reliable manner. Robomart Robomart, a literally little mini-mart on wheels. It is engineered with cutting-edge technology, including driverless tech for autonomy and teleoperations, an RFID and computer vision-based checkout-free system, and purpose-built refrigeration and temperature control. The bots are now used by Grocery store chain, Stop & Shop to deliver groceries to its customers. When customers want to buy some groceries, they simply tap a button in a smartphone app to request the nearest robomart. Once it arrives, they head outside, unlock the doors, and pick the products they want. Robomart tracks what customers have taken using patent-pending ""grab and go"" checkout-free technology and will charge them and send a receipt accordingly. TeleRetail Robot Using artificial intelligence to automate local logistics and minimize the ecological footprint of transportation, TeleRetail wants to help Main Street shops and small businesses to compete with major e-commerce companies like Amazon. The robot is made by the Swiss startup TeleRetail founded in 2014 by Torsten Scholl with the aim of solving the logistical problems of local businesses. With its 84 centimeter width and capability to carry up to 35 kilograms payloads, the robot is designed to travel on sidewalks, covering long distances up to about 80 kilometers Amazon Scout Entering the race of autonomous delivery robots is nonother than the e-commerce giant, Amazon. Amazon Scout, a six-wheeled self-driving delivery machine that is ""the size of a small cooler"". Walking at a human pace, Scout uses self-driving technology to navigate through neighborhoods to deliver packages to Amazon Prime Customers. The vehicle appears large enough to accommodate small and medium-sized parcels, but no word yet on what's under the hood. FedEx SameDay Bot So far, FedEx SameDay Bot is the latest of a long line of last-mile delivery robots that transport small packages from shops or local distribution centers directly to consumers. FedEx says it will refine it, and then begin deployment as soon as the company’s engineers are satisfied with its performance. The bot is being developed by FedEx in collaboration with DEKA Development & Research Corp., the company behind mobility device iBot. It features pedestrian-safe tech, multiple cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and machine learning to help it detect and avoid obstacles, and navigate uneven surfaces. Updates: Domino pizza chain announced that it has entered into a partnership with Nuro, a robotics delivery startup, to test using its robots to transport pizzas from a store in Houston.
