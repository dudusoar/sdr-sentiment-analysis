  Sample 1: These things in theory are good but that's where the good ends , we have a huge part of the population walking around in these locations and the bots just end up creating more traffic hazards and confusion in said locations. They may work well inside company buildings or schools but we are already way to lazy & out of shape .....
  Sample 2: thanks for that explanations I think we are living in a sad and very worrying world feel sorry for the generations to come
  Sample 3: If AI becomes self-aware, it'll be upset to find out we built their ancestors as slaves. XD
  Sample 4: The future is depopulation. That's what the wealthy want.
  Sample 5: I can only imagine how many kids mess with those things,and people's food gets delivered late
