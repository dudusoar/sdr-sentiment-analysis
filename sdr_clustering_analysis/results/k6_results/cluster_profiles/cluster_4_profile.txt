Sample Comments:
  Sample 1: Yup because people definitely won't just disrupt the robots or steal them. People do spontaneous things and to just say people don't do such things is bollocks.
  Sample 2: Great to see the robot is still working hard. How does it compare to scooter food delivery? And was Amazon Prime's blue delivery robot using your robot or did they stole the idea?
  Sample 3: Jimmy Kimmel is more excited about the robot than in the comments lol. I guess people don’t like change. But change is inevitable. Whose the hot hooters girl?
  Sample 4: That could've been a child passing. Lucky it was a robot instead
  Sample 5: That is one polite robot! It is a very cool concept although I feel like it is only helpful right now in areas such as university or office complexes. How did the coffee turn out after the delivery?
